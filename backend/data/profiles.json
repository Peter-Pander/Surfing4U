He was treated at the scene before being taken to hospital.\n\nTuesday's event featured 10 teams comprised of two athletes, alternating between surfing and driving the team's ski. Each team competed twice in hour-long heats with a priority system to ensure all riders were able to catch sizable waves.\n\nHawaii's Kai Lenny claimed the men's wave of the day. While France's Justine Dupont captured the women's title. Lenny and teammate Lucas Chianca of Brazil won the team competition.\n\nSource: WORLD SURF LEAGUE\nTopics: Disaster/Accidents, Sea Accidents\nSource News Feeds: Audio Soundbites, Reuters Marketplace - Video\nUSN: OVC0BBIAP\nID: tag:reuters.com,2020:newsml_OVC0BBIAP:1"

        "description": "Ah time! Our dear time, what a pleasure to be talking about you. You who decides of everything, who regulates our day and our life, and, at some point, who defines what is fast and what is, by opposition, slow. Zoé is definitely fast, running around all day, never losing a second. I, on the contrary, can be considered as slow. My life is basically slow in the morning and not too fast in the afternoon which is funny because you manage to see things differently.\n\nTake a camera for example. Its speed determine how much time its sensor will have to print everything it sees on a card or a film. Set it up on a high shutter speed, at around 1/2000 sec, it will only show you what happens in this timeframe as it will assemble into an image. Less data equals sharp images.\nNow, set it up on a low speed, at around 10 sec. With A LOT more data to assemble, it will first take time to process (I told you it was slow...) and then you will end up with a very blurry outcome. No perfect recollection of what happened, but a special interpretation, giving you, more or less, only a vibe of the moment.\n\nAnd now, welcome to my slow life, where everything is a blur!\n\nWith that in mind, and our life being so fast, everyone trying their best to do more and fit the most into their day, I thought it was time to sit down and enjoy the moment. Having Zoé as a muse was obvious, as she has always been open to new ideas, really motivated, curious and a really smooth and talented longboarder. I also thought mixing someone fast with something slow could be interesting.\n\nAnd with all that reading, you still don't know what it's about... Don't worry, I'll get to it! So, initially, with this project, I wanted to slow things down (not her surfing though), and focus on things we don't normally have time to focus on. Take gliding for example. How is gliding on a longboard different? How does it feel? What is the best feeling Zoé can get? Hard questions to answer with words as we don't take time to reflect on them. \"Dance\", \"approach\", \"elegance\", \"flying\", \"addictive\", and  \"art\" came into the discussion which, as you understood, does not focus on surf performance.\n\nTo emphasize my point about slow, I decided to shoot Zoe’s fast surfing with a slow shutter speed, gathering the best moments of our discussion with the best images. All of this topped by a music specially composed to suit her surfing, her style and her feelings. The outcome is about putting the original vibes of surfing into the main focal point, with a slow edit all about the vibes of Zoé Grospiron's surfing."

She’d been waiting for the chance to get solid Teahupo’o, and she wasn’t about to miss the opportunity.\n\n“A week or so before the swell hit my brother Tim texted me about the forecast, and it looked amazing,” Bethany told us. “I was hoping it was a bit bigger to whip a few but it wasn’t. It was a fun challenge to paddle with some of the guys though! I’m always game to go to beautiful Tahiti! It’s such a beautiful and intimidating wave. For me, positioning and direction of swell is super important for catching waves.\n\n“Over the years I’ve learnt that you’ve got to be willing to try the so-called ‘impossible’ and hold true to who you are and what gets you fired up.”\n\nAnd for Bethany, that’s chasing Teahupo’o. Watch her do her thing…"

Massive, heaving bowls, tippy-toe air drops, a few 2-wave hold-downs, Jet Skis and inflatable vests were a prevalent sight as well.\n\nThat -- and a South African named Twiggy, who pretty much owned the entire day.\n\nWhile in the early rounds, guys like last year's champ Peter Mel and Ryan Augenstein put on a clinic, flexing that local knowledge, the semis also had their share of epic battles.\n\nWhile Greg Long dueled with Shaun Dollar, Mark Healey dueled with a set on the head, a perspective caught on his GoPro cam attached to his board -- which you NEED to watch on the site's heat analyzer. Truly unbelievable.\nBut then the final rolled around and the man with a heart like a Nor-Cal redwood with a nickname called Twiggy, stole the show, catching twice as many waves as the other five guys in the heat, including a gut-wrenching perfect 10.\n\nRoss Williams said it best of the man, \"Twiggy doesn't just go for broke, he also shows control, riding every wave all the way into the channel. But he's usually deepest too, of course.\"\n\nIndeed he was. So deep on most in fact, that Twiggy was airdropping on his toes, then catching a heel-side rail, but regaining to push around the guillotine. Bawse-drops.\n\nAlthough 2nd place Shane Dorian surely gave Baker a run for his money, also air-dropping into a few impossibly steep and rowdy bowls, Twigs prevailed, a man utterly possessed the entire event.\n\nSaid the sponsorless Twiggy Baker, \"The prize money's great, but the thing is, even if none of us had sponsors or there was no event: we'd still all be out here today. We just love it.\" Amen, you maniac, you.\n\nThe Finals results go as follows:\n\n1. Grant \"Twiggy\" Baker — 29.33\n2. Shane Dorian — 25.532\n3. Ryan Augenstein— 16.663\n4. Tyler Fox — 12.664\n5. Greg Long — 12.000\n6. Anthony Tashnick — 0.006\n\n_________________________________\n\nExperience the world of Red Bull like you have never seen it before.

I was born and raised on the South Shore of Kauai. Growing up near the ocean, I fell in love with its beauty and power. I started surfing at the age of 4. My older sister Gabrielle and my dad taught me how to surf on a longboard. They would push me into waves, and from that day on I was hooked. I love how free and alive I feel in the ocean. It is such an indescribable feeling to be able to ride a wave, always thinking how special it is that you can only ride that wave once, you will never get the same wave again!\n\nI started competing at the age of 10, winning my first surf competition when I was 11 years old and from that moment I knew I wanted to be a professional surfer. I have been competing ever since. I am currently competing on the World Surf League qualifying series, traveling across the globe for competitions! My ultimate goal is to be on the world tour. I have always been a firm believer of “where there is a will there is a way”. In 2018 I came out with a documentary called “ Surfing to Cope” which is now on iTunes.\n\nDo you have questions about Sol-ti?

World record waves around 100ft (30m) rogue waves, largest waves world record Biggest wave in the world Large wave, swell storm tsunami, code, red, jaws, teahupoo\n\nBig wave surfing is the ultimate celebration of extreme surfing. Challenging deadly waves in harsh weather and ocean conditions takes a very serious approach.\nBig wave surfers are not interested in performance. Forget perfect cutbacks, stunning floaters or breathless aerial antics. The profile of a big wave rider is the result of several unparalleled personal characteristics.\n\nFear is always present in a 50-foot wave. Fear is the best way of managing the risk of paddling for a huge wave face, which doesn't tell you what is going to happen and how it is going to break.\n\nMonster waves tend to move quickly and force surfers to get away of the powerful whitewater. Big waves are lethal even for the most experienced extreme riders. The best big wave surf spots in the world have claimed several lives in the last decades.\n\nMalik Joyeux, Sion Milosky, Moto Watanabe, Mark Foo, Donnie Solomon, Todd Chesser, Dickie Cross and Peter Davi have passed away in extreme surfing conditions. Wipeouts, severe coral reef injuries and drowning are the most common causes of death in big wave surfing.\n\nThe pioneers of big wave surfing started to eye impossible killer rides in the 1940's. In the 1960's, waves like Pipeline and Waimea increased the popularity of paddling into new wave heights. Going over the falls was the daily menu.\n\nLaird Hamilton is the first professional big wave surfer. The waterman from Maui defies fast, hollow and high waves with a full-time training and previous preparation. Hamilton, the father of tow-in surfing, takes on the entire big wave spots of the Hawaiian Islands, in helicopter style.\n\nLaird was born with the gene of defying danger. He designs and prepares his own surfboards and wetsuits. Wherever heavy waves break, Hamilton is there to ride them: Mavericks, Cortes Bank, Dungeons.\n\n\nGarrett McNamara is one of the toughest big wave challengers. After riding a spectacular 78-foot wave in Nazaré, Portugal, the Hawaiian waterman entered the Guinness World Records with the biggest wave ever surfed.\n\nThe 55 best big wave surfers of all time is an exclusive extreme surfing club. From Jaws to Mavericks, Puerto Escondido, Punta Lobos, Ghost Trees, Belharra, Shipstern Bluff and Todos Santos, these riders have set up a new scale in the definition of giant waves. \n\n\n***************************************************************            \nNo copyright infringement inteded and i don't have earnings from this video...\nIf you are the owner of this content (image or footage) and you want the delete of this video, please contact me inbox and i will do it immediately.\nAlso if you are the owner of this content (image or footage) and you wish, i can add your links in description (fb page, website, buy links etc)\n***************************************************************\n                                                 \n                                                \n\n\n\nAl Mennie\nAnthony Tashnick\nBen Wilkinson\nBob Pike\nBrock Little\nBuzzy Trent\nCarlos Burle\nChris Bertish\nDanilo Couto\nDarrick Doerner Darryl Virostko\nDave Kalama\nDave Wassel\nGabriel Villaran\nGarrett McNamara\nGeorge Downing\nBrad Gerlach\nGerry Lopez\nGrant Twiggy Baker Grant Washburn\nGreg Long\nGreg Noll\nIan Walsh\nJamie Sterling\nJay Moriarty\nJeff Clark\nJeff Rowley\nJose Angel\nJoão de Macedo\nKai Barger Keala Kennely\nKen Bradshaw\nKen Colllins\nKoby Abberton\nKohl Christensen\nLaird Hamilton\nLaurie Towner\nMark Foo\nMark Healey\nMark Mathews\nMark Visser Maya Gabeira\nMike Parsons\nNathan Fletcher\nPat Curren\nPeter Mel\nRamon Navarro\nRichie Fitzgerald\nRoss Clarke-Jones\nShane Dorian\nSion Milosky\nZach Wormhoudt $$$ huhi tsm windsurfing skt clg 7.16"

Surfers catch ocean, river, or man-made waves, and glide across the surface of the water until the wave breaks and loses its energy.\nIn the ocean, wave riders stand up on surfboards and navigate the water - nearly parallel to the beach - toward the shore. There are four types of surfing waves: spilling waves, plunging waves, surging waves, and collapsing waves. The ultimate goal of surfing is to ride and progress on the unbroken part of the wave using a surfboard. Nevertheless, beginners can learn to surf in the whitewater part of the wave.\n\nMany surf historians and enthusiasts believe that the essence of surfing is in bodysurfing, the art of gliding over the waves using only the body as a planing surface. \n\nTop  8 Greatest Surfers of All Time \nKelly Slater\nDuke Kahanamoku\nLayne Beachley\nCorky Carroll \nStephanie Gilmore\nJoyce Hoffman\nLaird Hamilton\nLisa Andersen  \n\n#Surfing #TopSurfers #SurfersBestMoment #BigWaves #InsaneMoment \n#insanesurfers #Surfing2020Compilation \n\n*Don't forget to subscribe and hit that Bell button \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-PT8kMYtQTfcY27QJUpSGg?view_as=subscriber"

To beat those guys in such good waves makes me even happier and I am not sure what to do from here\"\n\n\" I was supposed to go to Uni this year after a year of globetrotting but now I have some decisions to make, actually a sponsor would help me make that decision with some support\" he added.\n\nThe day started with some amazing waves rolling off the famed reef and the best riders in the world relished in the conditions.\n\n\" I really enjoy watching the Drop knee events\" said IBA Tour manager terry McKenna\n\n\" Its like a hybrid of bodyboarding and surfing and adds a whole new dimension to the world tour\"\n\nIn the opening rounds there were some major standouts\n\nPort Macquarie locals Damian King and Mason Rose looked comfy on the rights and both scored big with deep tubes and front-side gaffs.\n\nKianoa McGee was also impressive as he continued to prove his versatility as one of the worlds best watermen when he continuously dialed up set after set and played hide and seek with the judges.\n\nPortugal's Rui Perriera also showed why he is regarded as one of the best European's with stylish positioning and controlled barrels. \n\nThe quarterfinals saw some of the more fancied favorites like Dave Hubbard (Hawaii) and Matt Lakey (Aust), Ardiel Jimenez (Canary Islands) exit the event as the conditions became inconsistent and wave selection became paramount.\n\nThe highlight was Ryan Hardy's 9-point cavernous barrel that had the crowd hooting.\n\nThe quit achiever of the day was Miles Kauhaahaa (Hawaii) who constantly found the best waves and showed glimpses of brilliance to dominate all of his heats.\n\nSemi finals are always tough but at Pipe in the first Grand Slam of the year they are complicated.\n\nKianoa and Amaury wanted to go front-side but the N in the swell meant that the rights were dishing up the higher scores and both were sidelined by the left foot forward duo of Feast and Bauer.\n\nDave Winchester and Miles Kauhaahaa dominated the second semi and Hardy and McMullin were left wanting.\n\nAt this point the DK crew were given a breather as the IBA walked down memory lane with a tribute to the rich history of the sport and the event.\n\nThe Legends final was a masterstroke that showcased a handful of bodyboarding icons from the 90's that had either won the event or played a major role in the development of the sport in a 30 minute final.\n\nThe following riders were selected\n\nSteve \"Bullet\" MacKenzie (Winner 1996)\n\nMichael \"Eppo\" Eppulstun (Winner 1993)\n\nBen \" Tube troll\" Seversen (Winner 1986)\n\nPat \"Noodle\" Caldwell (Inventor of the el-rollo)\n\nHauoli \"Martian\" Reeves (Vibrant Hawaiian character)\n\nThese guys wound back the clock and old scores were settled as they traded blows and showed that they still have the skills that originally made them a household name.\n\nCaldwell lead early and then the Aussie duo of Bullet and Eppo upped the ante with deep tubes and perfect positioning.\n\nBen Seversen made a late charge but a deep shack sealed the deal late and Bullet walked away the winner.\n\n\" I loved it\" said Bullet \n\n\" Having my family here and surfing against the boys again was such a buzz and I hoped the spectators loved it as much as us\"\n\nEppo was second, Seversen third Pat claimed forth and Hauoli fifth.\n\nThis was a lighthearted lead in to an intense final and despite the surf being somewhat inconsistent Feasty grabbed two deep tubes to seal it.\n\nSecond place in the final went to the current world champion Cesar Bauer from Peru.\n\nBauer was throwing tail and drifting through his now trademark tail whips but when it comes to Pipe the tubes are what scores big and that's what Feast concentrated on.\n\nThird place went to Winny and forth was Miles.\n\nIt was a perfect start to the 2011 DKWT and sets up the possible final day of competition for Tuesday.\n\nStay tuned for another call at 6.30am tomorrow\n\nMUSIC// Mother and Son \"Creature form the Swamp\""

        "description": "Flashback: John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd Force Brian Wilson to Surf\n‘Surf Police’ order the Beach Boy into Los Angeles ocean on a 1976 NBC special\n\nThe Beach Boys were in the middle of a major comeback when they hit the road in the summer of 1976 to promote their new album, 15 Big Ones. Earlier in the decade they were struggling to fill theaters and seemed hopelessly passé, but the huge success of American Graffiti in 1973 and stadium reunion tours by CSNY and Bob Dylan with the Band the following years showed that 1960s nostalgia could be extremely lucrative when presented in the right way.\n\nKicking off the Beach Boys comeback was the greatest hits double LP Endless Summer, which hit shelves in June of 1974. Richard Nixon was two months away from resigning and the country was in a deep funk, so millions of people were delighted to relive their carefree youth by putting “Fun, Fun, Fun” and “I Get Around” on their turntables. The album shot to Number One and Beach Boys tickets began selling like crazy. The group responded by putting together a new backing band and devoting nearly its entire show to 1960s classics.\n\nThe Beach Boys played a staggering amount of concerts in 1974 and 1975, but by 1976 they knew it was time to actually cut a new album. Manager Steve Love came up with the idea of a “Brian’s Back” campaign where the long-absent Beach Boy would produce the disc and join the group on tour for the first time in over a decade. It was the best way to maximize attention for the project, even though Wilson was 250 pounds and battling severe addiction and mental health issues.\n\nHe was placed under the care of Dr. Eugene Landy and coaxed into the studio, which caused no small degree of turmoil in a band that had grown used to operating in his absence. This also wasn’t the Wilson of 1966 and he had virtually no new songs or a clear idea of what he wanted to accomplish, so they ultimately decided to concentrate on cover songs like Chuck Berry’s “Rock and Roll Music” and the Dixie Cups’ “Chapel of Love.” The handful of Beach Boys originals like “That Same Song” and “Susie Cincinnati” were, to be charitable, underwhelming.\n\nThis all took place just as Saturday Night Love was becoming a major cultural force, and creator Lorne Michaels was a huge fan of the group. He got NBC to air a special called The Beach Boys: It’s OK in November that would mix live concert clips with comedy segments like Dennis Wilson judging a beauty pageant and Mike Love on an airplane. The highlight was an amazing bit where John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd dress up like the “Surf Police” and march into Brian’s bedroom, telling him that he’s in violation of the “Catch A Wave Statute” and he has no choice but to go surfing.\n\nThe scene switches to a Trancas, California, beach where Brian is forced into the water, still wearing his robe, and somehow manages to not drown while attempting to surf. The joke, of course, is that the author of “Surfin’ U.S.A.” had never actually been surfing. “He was not happy about it,” Michaels told Rolling Stone in 2006. “It was almost a baptism.”\n\nRolling Stone photographer Annie Leibovitz was on the beach at the time and captured the amazing image that appeared on the cover of a November 1976 issue. In a 2006 interview with Rolling Stone, Wilson said he could vividly recall the photo shoot. “I was saying to myself, ‘God, I hope I can keep this robe on so nobody can see my belly!'” he said. “I was very self-conscious about my weight. When you look at this [cover], my belly doesn’t look that big because I have the robe on, but believe me, it’s big!”"

Everyone who took part, whether it be watching from afar via our live broadcast, standing on the beach with jaws hanging down to the sand, or in the water trying to hunt — we’ll all have different memories. But when it comes down to winning the day, here’s the waves that really counted. As you watch, bear in mind how the event is judged in the context of the Bay’s unique complexities: the panel is looking for wave size, critical positioning on takeoff (ie steep and deep), control of the drop, and successful “make”, ie completion of the ride through and past the wave base. Rides into the shorebreak, while serious crowd-pleasers, aren’t big points-adders: as you’ll note from this selection, the big points come from those first 10-20 seconds of the ride — which also relies on the decision to go in the first place. (Also worth noting: waves are scored out of a possible 30, rather than 10. Also, Mark Healey’s wave above was so close — 29.6 — that we had to include here.)\n\nIt was an amazing day, however you saw it. We hope you enjoy these seven moments of magic.\n\nResults (scores are out of a possible 90.)\n1. Luke Shepardson 89.1\n2. John John Florence 84.2\n3. Mark Healey 82.3\n4. Billy Kemper 79.5\n5.

You’re playing cat and mouse with an uneven rock ledge and a lot of swell energy, and you’re riding a board way bigger than you are. All the elements scream “CHARGE!” Yet even as you’re charging, all kinds of tiny things are happening. Little shifts of the board underfoot. Wind holding you up a fraction longer than you thought it might. You draw a simple line and it works, or it doesn’t. There’s a deep layer of grace and beauty under the wildness, and nowhere was it plainer to see than during yesterday Rip Curl Eddie Aikau Invitational, when the next generation of big wave greats showed all the skills and qualities this amazing event asks of a surfer.

In this episode, last year’s event champion and undisputed Queen of Pipe Moana Jones Wong tells us how she recently rode the best Pipe wave of all time by a female. Video Credit: Nigel Aird\n\nWe all have one — that ride of a lifetime when everything comes together and becomes the personal benchmark for every wave ridden in the future. But when it comes to Pipeline, a ride like no other has a tendency to take on a more significant meaning. For some: it’s life-changing. For others: borderline-spiritual. At the very least, it’s guaranteed to stay seared in their memory for eternity. On the eve of the 2023 Billabong Pro Pipeline, we’ve created a series dedicated to those committed, skilled and fortunate enough to have caught “The One” at the world’s most famous, most dangerous wave. And hoping this inspires a few more “Best Ones Ever” at this event and beyond. \n\nAs the epicenter of the surf universe and the birthplace of the sport, it’s only right for Pipeline to kick off the Championship Tour. Everyone enters the season with equal hopes of winning it all. The rookie class is thrown into the fire, the contenders return with one thing on their minds, and the surf world begins to follow the road to the Rip Curl WSL Finals.

He describes living in Western Australia on a farm, surfing all the different waves there including Strickland Bay, the site of the Rip Curl Rottnest Search, and then explains how they relate to some of the iconic breaks on the North Shore. He tells stories from his own successful competitive career, talks title aspirations, details how he knew it was time to hang it up, and calls winning The Duke in 1975 the highlight of his career. \n\n#WSL\n\nSubscribe to the WSL for more action: https://goo.gl/VllRuj\n\nWatch all the latest surfing action of the world's best surfers in the world's best waves.

Hawaii was seen as the center of the surfing universe and the brash Aussies sought to shake things up. Along with South Africans Shaun and Michael Tomson, the crew ripped apart legendary breaks like Pipeline and Waimea with radical innovations and bravery that bordered on insanity. Combining classic footage and revealing modern-day interviews, Bustin' Down the Door exposes the soul of this revolutionary period in a way few surf films can. The ground-breaking talents of MR and Co. are rightfully lauded for helping to build the concept of professional surfing, yet no excuses are offered for the reckless arrogance that helped ignite a powder keg of cultural pride on the North Shore. The self-promoting Australians were not shy about their talents, but by the time Cairns declared that \"Aloha is dead\" during the summer of '75, competitive banter had dangerously escalated beyond the waves. But what the group lacked in diplomacy, they made up for in determination, as their shared desire to be the best gave rise to a new era of surfing."

Harrison shone across the earlier divisions today, posting a massive two-wave 16.43 total in the round of 32 as well as a decent 14.26 total in the quarterfinals. Harrison will meet Tim Bain (Sunshine Coast, Qld), Mannix Squiers (Wollongong, NSW) and Xavier Bryce (Long Reef, NSW) in his semi-final tomorrow.\n\nHarry Martin (Gold Coast, Qld), Oliver Ryssenbeek (Newcastle, NSW), Rico Haybittle (Burleigh, Qld) and Mitchell Peterson (Noosa, Qld) will feature in the second Pro Junior semi-final tomorrow.\n\n15-year-old Milla Brown (Bungan, NSW) put on a clinic in the solid conditions, smashing out a series of critical re-entries to lock in a decent 14.53 two-wave heat total in the quarterfinal of the Women's Pro Junior division. Competing against fellow standout Sierra Kerr (Coolangatta, Qld), Brown showed she wasn't daunted, as she nailed the aforementioned score and claimed the win in the quarterfinal. Brown then backed up her performance in the Under-18 Girls division posting the only perfect 10-point ride of the event, for a giant frontside straight air, which she was then able to back up with an excellent 9.4 to take her two-wave total to 19.40, the highest heat total of the entire event so far.\n\nOther Women's Pro Junior standouts included Ava Holland (Dromana, Vic), Rosie Smart (Coffs Harbour, NSW) and Isla Huppatz (Bilinga, Qld) who all won their respective quarterfinal battles.\n\nAll champions will be crowned tomorrow. \n\nThe six-day event has run from 6 July –11 July 2023 and will comprise of a World Surf League (WSL) sanctioned Pro Junior Qualifying Series (JQS) event as well as an elite competition for promising grommets in the 14, 16 and 18-year age divisions.\n\nIn a similar vein to preceding years – where the event has attracted surfers from ten different countries – a full international field is again expected in 2023 with surfers coming from as far away as Europe, USA, Hawaii, Indonesia and Japan to make up a field of more than 270 surfers across all divisions.\n\nA five-person judging panel comprised of current WSL Championship Tour and Qualifying Series judges will be on-site as well as a live webcast that collectively sets this event above any other junior competition in the world.\n\nFormer event competitors include a range of current and former World Championship Tour such as, Molly Picklum, Mikey, Owen and Tyler Wright, Jack Robinson, reigning World Junior Champion Jarvis Earle and local surfers Mikey McDonagh and Nyxie Ryan.\n\nThe event will get underway by 7.00am tomorrow for the final.\n\nAll event divisions are broadcast live worldwide on skullcandyozgromopen.com.au from Friday, 7th July, 2023\"\n\nCopy Courtesy of Surfing NSW and Ethan Smith.\nVideo Courtesy of Value Imagery!"

Henry made light work of the difficult surf to seal his position in the second round and make it known that he’s gunning for another title to add to his already over-flowing resume.\n\nContinuing on from his stellar performance in the Under-16 Boys, Ocean Lancaster (Merewether, NSW) mustered up some last-minute heroics to sneak through his opening round exchange in the Pro Junior division. Needing a solid score in the final minutes of the exchange, Lancaster belted one mammoth backhand snap that was rewarded with a respectable 6.67 wave score which propelled him into a progressing position.\n\nLennix Smith (Shellharbour, NSW) showed why he’s considered the future of Australian surfing, nailing a series of critical snaps and carves to cement a spot into the second round.\nOther round one standouts included Fletcher Kelleher (Manly, NSW), Ty Richardson (Palm Beach, Qld), Ben Zanatta Creagh (Dee Why, NSW) and Luke Brumby (Sunshine Coast, Qld) who all notched up heat totals in excess of 12.00 points.\n\nIn the women’s division, Tayla Green (NZL) showed that risky surfing would be rewarded by the judges when she executed a series of successful critical carves. The powerful natural footer hammered an array of sections in the challenging surf to post an excellent 8.00 wave score and a 7.50 to take her two-wave total to 15.50.\n\nIsla Huppatz (Gold Coast, Qld) showed she was a force to be reckoned with, finishing her heat with a decent 11.76 two-wave heat total. She will now meet fellow event standouts Ruby Berry (WA), Olive Hardy (WA) and Milla Brown (Bungan, NSW) in an electric round two match up.\n\nDay three of the competition (Saturday, 6th July) will see more Pro Junior rounds hitting the water followed by the commencement of the Under-18 division.\n\nThe iconic six-day event will run from 4 July – 9 July 2024 and will comprise of a World Surf League (WSL) sanctioned Pro Junior Qualifying Series (JQS) event as well as an elite competition for promising grommets in the 14, 16 and 18 year age divisions.\n\nIn a similar vein to previous years - where the event has attracted surfers from ten different countries - a full international field is again expected in 2024 with surfers coming from as far away as Europe, the USA, Hawaii, Indonesia and Japan to make up a field of more than 180 surfers across all divisions.\n\nFormer event competitors include a range of current and former World Championship Tour and Challenger Series surfers, such as Macy Callaghan, Molly Picklum, Mikey, Owen and Tyler Wright, Jack Robinson and local surfers Ocea Curtis and Nyxie Ryan.\n\nWatch the best moments from Day 2 of the Skullcandy Oz Grom Open presented by O'Neill.

I hit so hard when I fell I'm not sure if I blacked out or not. But I remember getting sucked over and then was instantly on the bottom and pinned to the rocks on my back.\"\n\n\"There was so much intensity down there. I don't even know how to explain it. Thank God it finally let me up, and I hit the surface with a second to spare before the next one mowed me,\" continued Jamie.\n\n\"I saw stars after that.

The film has been newly edited and features a new digital soundtrack. Greg MacGillivray says it’s the best version yet!\n\n\"Five Summer Stories\" first premiered in 1972 at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium and was quickly deemed “the greatest surf film ever made.”  The film’s unusual format—a montage of stories or vignettes—perfectly captured a fractured era in which an explosion of creativity and revolutionary change was shaking down the old order, taking the sport of surfing off into new and unknown territory. Although the film went through several (and increasingly popular) incarnations as it played in theaters over a 7-year span from 1972 to 1979, its fundamental story remained the same—that the pure, innocent joy of surfing was symbolic of humankind’s best possibilities on Earth without war or politics or environmental destruction. \n\nFeatures the music of the Beach Boys and Honk.\n\nFor more information, visit https://fivesummerstories.com.\n\n“My favorite surf movie of all time.”\n--Laird Hamilton\n\n“Dazzling”\n--Rolling Stone\n\n“The greatest surf movie ever made”\n--Sam George, Surfline\n\n“An incredible barrage of audio-visual stimulus.”\n--Surfer Magazine"

Ben (voice of Sam Elliott) is a cow who for years has been the leader and sober voice of reason among the animals at a farm where the critters are a bit unusual -- they can walk on two legs, talk, swim, and act like humans, though they have the good sense to avoid doing these things while humans are around. Ben has long dreamed that his son Otis (voice of Kevin James) would someday take over his duties on the farm, but Otis is a carefree and irresponsible type who would rather party with his friends and hang out with his girlfriend, Daisy (voice of Courteney Cox). Ben and his friend Miles (voice of Danny Glover), a wise and patient mule, wonder if Otis will ever make anything of himself, while Dasiy's best friend, Bessy (voice of Wanda Sykes), is convinced she can do better. However, one night Otis decides to do something about an obnoxious kid who enjoys tipping his fellow cows, and for the first time in his life he gets a taste of leadership -- and he likes it. Barnyard also features the voice talents of Andie MacDowell, Maria Bamford, and Maurice LaMarche.\n\nCREDITS:\nTM & © Paramount (2006)\nCast: Cam Clarke, Jeffrey Garcia, Dom Irrera, Kevin James, Rob Paulsen\nDirector: Steve Oedekerk\nProducers: Mark Beam, Nicholisa Contis, Andrew Egiziano, Pam Marsden, Paul Marshal, Steve Oedekerk, Aaron Parry, Julia Pistor\nScreenwriter: Steve Oedekerk\n\nWHO ARE WE?\nThe MOVIECLIPS channel is the largest collection of licensed movie clips on the web.

        "description": "When Filmmaker Minna Dufton started her documentary about elite big wave champion surfer, the \"tiny fighter\" Joana Andrade who rides the powerhouse waves at Nazaré, Portugal (home of the 100ft World Record Wave surfed by Garrett McNamara), little did she know Joana harbored a deep secret.\n​\nBy way of explaining the safety equipment big wave surfers use, Joana shared her deep fear of drowning, something many big wave surfers share. In that one extraordinary moment, a remarkable cinematic serendipity would unfold and bring together the tiny Portuguese surfer with Finnish world champion free diver, Johanna Nordblad for the most unusual of training sessions.\n​\nBIG vs SMALL is a modern-day fairytale stretching from the raging monster waves in the south to the dark stillness of a far-north, frozen Finnish lake; it's about power and strength on top of the water, and facing demons under it. It's about trust, it's about letting go, and it's about what happens when two elite female champions share their extraordinary talent with each other.\n​\nBecause, the battle isn't on the wave."

After twelve years competing at the elite level on the ASP World Championship Tour, a stretch that saw him win eleven elite ASP World Title Events, plus nine additional ASP tour events, and achieve runner-up second place to the ASP World Title four times, Parkinson won the ASP World Championship Tour Surfing Title on 14 December 2012 in Hawaii at the Banzai Pipeline during the ASP World Tours' final event for 2012–the Billabong Pipeline Masters. Parkinson hung on in a back and forth battle with eleven-time ASP World Title holder, Kelly Slater, to get his first World Title, as well as go on to win the Pipeline Masters, only after Slater lost his semi-final heat to Josh Kerr, of Queensland, Australia. Parkinson beat Kerr in the finals of the event, which was his seventh top-five placing for the year, and his first event title win for 2012. Parkinson left the World Tour and left a legacy of a beautiful and powerful surfing.",

Este año ha sido el TOP. Cuatro Juniors en el equipo capaces de ser campeones Mundiales en Open, sin dudar en lo que digo. Y las chicas subiendo de nivel como la espuma. Estas dos fueron las claves de la victoria del equipo vasco en el Mundial de Kayaksurf en Pantín 2015, además del buen nivel de los Másters y los Open.\n\nUn nivel que se ha logrado a base de constancia, en el entrenamiento y el trabajo duro de las escuelas de kayaksurf en Euskadi, entre los que destaca, con un papel protagonista, el equipo del Náutico de San Sebastián. Una labor sin la cual no se podrían entender los éxitos que el combinado vasco ha ido cosechando desde el año 2007. \n\nAdemás de esto, la estructura organizativa de la Selección, que poco a poco se va afianzando, ayuda a su cohesión y a sus buenos resultados.\n\nLa alegría desbordante que vivimos el día de las finales por equipos no fue solo por nuestro 4º Título mundial, si no tambien porque lo lográbamos en un Mundial de mucha categoría, en el corazón mundial del Kayaksurf, a donde acudió la gran mayoría de sus practicantes. Por lo tanto, la victoria tambien fue contra las mayores potencias, como la de Inglaterra, Gales e Irlanda. Y las victorias contra los mejores saben mejor.\n\nCon muchísimas ganas para repetirlo el próximo Mundial, que se celebrará en Irlanda en 2017, quedamos muy contentos con los trofeos cosechados y nos autohomenajeamos con un vídeo rememorando los momentos de esta dulce y gran victoria, que sumamos a nuestro palmarés. \n\nGora Euskal Kayaksurf Selekzioa!!!!\n\nXabi Olano (miembro de EHKSS)"

        "description": "Justine Dupont’s à la folie showcases the “best year” of her surfing life\n\nFrom her beloved Nazaré and across the seas to Mavericks and Jaws, Justine Dupont just compiled a career season, but the Frenchwoman is far from finished.\n\nOver the 2020/21 Northern Hemisphere winter, French surfer Justine Dupont put on what some are calling the most dominant performance that female big wave riding has ever seen. Now, thanks to à la folie, a Red Bull Media House 32-minute biopic, you can join her for the highest highs and lowest lows, life-changing wipeouts and insane barrels.\n\n“À la folie means ‘with a lot of passion’”, says Justine. “It does for me anyway, because otherwise, it means ‘madness’, and that’s not what I see my surfing as. I definitely have a lot of passion when it comes to surfing big waves.\n\n“Last year was my best season yet, so it was a great feeling to have that all captured in this film, to show off how I was feeling, how I do everything with my team, and all of the work beyond just the surfing.”\n\nJustine Dupont’s history with surfing hasn’t always been geared towards big waves; rather, this has been a passion developed over years of exploring the ocean and all that it has to offer. She first started surfing at age 11, stealing her father’s shortboard to sneak off to the beach and get a few waves.\n\nA runner-up finish in the World Junior Championships in 2011 announced her arrival on the shortboard scene and she quickly qualified for the Championship Tour later that same year. Injury cut short her major league dreams but it didn’t stop the silverware mounting up on her multi-disciplinary mantlepiece.\n\nFrom world stand-up paddleboard titles to finals finishes in the world longboarding Dupont could do it all, but when she first tasted the adrenalin of tow surfing at Belharra, at home in France, she finally found the discipline that would come to consume her every waking moment. Shortly after the big wave passion gripped her, Dupont moved to Portugal to tackle the infamous Nazaré whenever it broke.\n\nTwo Nazaré Tow Challenge victories later, her talents have now seen the Frenchwoman cross the seas to tackle Mavericks in California and Jaws in Maui, where she successfully navigated the best female tube ride of all time.\n\n“It’s nice to be recognised as one of the best big wave surfers in the world, for all sorts of reasons,” says Justine. “I’ve dedicated myself to Nazaré, to big waves, and it makes me feel like I’m doing the right thing. Being recognised means that I can follow my dreams, and follow the storms and the waves I want to surf.”\n\nStrap yourself in, hit play on the video above and prepare to enter the world of Justine Dupont, you're in for the ride of a lifetime.

All things considered, it's just water, isn't that so? \n\nHow about we not disregard the one time out of ten. It's the startling minute that abandons us thinking about how we ever got talked into this surfing thing in any case, and in spite of the fact that it is surely uncommon, it's additionally unavoidable.

        "description": "Laura Enever's Record-Setting Ride Measured at 43.6 Feet (13.3 Meters).\n\nLaura Enever, who is 31 years old and from North Narrabeen, Australia, successfully surfed a wave measuring 43.6 feet (13.3 meters) from trough to crest at Outer Reef, the big-wave break on the North Shore of Oahu, on January 22, 2023.\n\n\"I knew it was big when I paddled into it and then when I took off I looked down and I knew it was definitely the biggest wave I've ever caught,\" said Enever. \"I knew it was the wave of my life, the whole way it all came together and the way I committed, backed myself, told myself to go, and trusted I could do it. The ride was such a breakthrough for me and a moment that will be really special and monumental in my surf career. To get awarded this months later is really cool, I can't believe it.\n\n\"I would never be in this position if it wasn't for all the big wave surfers who have come before me and paved the way, especially the really brave, courageous females who have always inspired me and made me feel like I could get out there and give it a crack. So thank you to all the amazing women and I'm just constantly in awe. Andrea Moller held this record before me and it's an honor to hold that record and keep pushing big wave surfing. And I know that the next girls, the next generation of female big wave surfers are going to do the same.\"\n\nEnever's World Record adds to an already stellar surfing career. She was the ISA Junior World Champion and Triple Crown Rookie of the Year in 2008, and World Junior Champion in 2009. In 2011, Enever qualified for the WSL Championship Tour, where she competed for seven years, consistently finishing in the Top 10. She has gone on to compete in WSL Big Wave events and push the limits of big wave surfing.\n\n\"Huge congratulations to Laura for this incredible achievement,\" said Jessi Miley-Dyer, WSL Chief of Sport. \"Laura is fearless, committed, and a real inspiration, and I'm so proud to celebrate her. These World Records really allow us to shine the spotlight on athletes like Laura who are pushing the boundaries of Big Wave surfing.\"\n\nEnever was awarded the GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS™ certificate in her hometown of Narrabeen in New South Wales, Australia, where she celebrated the accomplishment with her family and friends. \n\n\"I've worked my whole life to be a professional surfer and to be on the World Tour,\" continued Enever. \"I was there and I gave that up for this pull and urge to surf big waves. I was just thinking I just wanted to go do this for me, and to be here today and to have a GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS™ title for the biggest paddle, I can't believe it.\"\n\nEnever's record bettered Andrea Moller's previous record by just one foot, which was caught on January 16, 2016, at Pe'ahi, Maui. Moller, an internationally recognized waterwoman, pioneer of big wave surfing, and respected paramedic, held the record for seven years. She was the first woman to paddle into a wave at Pe'ahi, the first woman to catch a wave in the prestigious Eddie Aikau big wave contest, and an advocate for equality and progression in big wave surfing.\n\nShop official 2023 Rip Curl WSL Finals merchandise here: https://www.wslstore.com/collections/2023-rip-curl-wsl-finals-collection\n\nShop 2023 official CT jerseys and new posters at WSLStore.com: https://www.wslstore.com/collections/...\n\n#WSL\n\nSubscribe to the WSL for more action: https://goo.gl/VllRuj\n\nWatch all the latest surfing action of the world's best surfers in the world's best waves.

With 19 years on tour, Layne saw it all: the sexism, the struggle, and the inequality in support, media coverage and sponsorship that the women had to endure.\n\nThe new movie GIRLS CAN'T SURF highlights those struggles, focusing on a group of brave women, who in the years before Layne's arrival as an athlete on the ASP World Tour, fought tooth and nail to even be allowed to surf.\n\nAlexa from Still Stoked was invited to host the Q&A sessions before the movie's National release, standing alongside Jodie Cooper, Pam Burridge, Director Chris Neilius, Producer Mickela Purskey and of course, Layne Beachley. Two neighbours that know each other from their local surf break, Alexa sat down with Layne before the Cronulla Girls Can't Surf premiere to chat about some of the stories that Layne had from that time.\n\nGIRLS CAN'T SURF is an incredible documentary. Please go and see it and take your friends, male and female, surfers and non-surfers as this story is sadly, as relevant today as it was all those years ago.\n\nFor more interviews with top female athletes, check out more of Still Stoked Chats: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anDpkKbzAxY&list=PLmjQQDHWhDYP1SI7NUUhLGMaxyO1hXD-b\n\nLAURA ENEVER INTERVIEW: https://youtu.be/LUeEHU9v8q8\nBELINDA BAGGS INTERVIEW: https://youtu.be/UA2MjgCHibo\nLIZ CLARKE: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZ9rX1hrC6c\nGEE CORMACK: https://youtu.be/lMAXCGUTG1Y"

        "description": "Brazilian charger Lucas “Chumbo” Chianca is fast making a name for himself as one of the world’s most fearless and highly skilled big wave surfers. While he was born and raised in Saquarema, best known as one of the WSL Championship Tour’s high performance stops, Chumbo has caught the global eye on the strength of his game when conditions go rogue, as seen in this latest instalment of My Last Two Winters. \n \nThe edit above sees Chumbo book an around-the-big-wave-world ticket from Nazaré, Portugal to Mavericks in California, across the Pacific to Tahiti, before finishing back at the scene of his greatest success, Praia do Norte in Nazaré. Here in Portugal we see Chumbo claim yet another trophy alongside his partner-in-XXL, Kai Lenny, as Team Young Bulls once again clean up at the WSL’s Nazare Tow Surfing Challenge. \n \nFor Chumbo however surfing is about much more than trophies, and this edit is a tribute to his dedication to his craft. For a surfer from Brazil to earn the respect that he has, and travel and surf with the crew that he does – take a bow Kai Lenny and Ian Walsh – speaks volumes about the level to which Chumbo pushes himself, and the pure spirit with which he does it. \n\nPress play above to take a sneak peak inside his wild world now, and be sure to read our exclusive interview with Lucas here: https://win.gs/40LJ6bp\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nO big rider brasileiro Lucas Chumbo está marcando seu nome como um dos surfistas de ondas grandes mais corajosos e habilidosos do planeta. Nascido e criado em Saquarema (RJ), terra de uma das etapas mais clássicas da WSL Championship Tour, Chumbo chocou o mundo inteiro pela força do seu surfe quando as condições estão terríveis, como no novo episódio de “My Last Two Winters”.\n\nO vídeo acima acompanha Chumbo pelo mundo das ondas gigantes partindo de Nazaré, Portugal, passando por Mavericks, na Califórnia, cruzando o Pacífico até o Taiti e finalizando no palco onde já está acostumado a brilhar: A Praia do Norte, em Nazaré. E é em Portugal que vemos Chumbo conquistar mais um troféu para o Team Young Bulls no WSL Nazaré Tow Surfing Challenge ao lado da sua dupla de ouro, Kai Lenny.\n\nPro Chumbo, surfar é muito mais que ganhar troféus, e esse vídeo é um tributo à sua dedicação ao esporte. Conseguir o respeito que ele tem no mundo inteiro e poder viajar e surfar com essa equipe insana - incluindo os brabos Kai Lenny e Ian Walsh -  fala muito mais sobre o nível que ele chegou e sobre o jeito leve que ele encara tudo isso.\n\nSolta o play pra sentir um gostinho desse mundo louco do Lucas, e não deixe de conferir sua entrevista exclusiva aqui: https://win.gs/40LJ6bp\n\nDirected by: Evan Fontaine \nExecutive Produced by: Marc Levy and Marc Salomon \nAdditional footage:\nMarch Chambers\nThe Marcs \nAbraham Alarcon\nJimmy Wilson\nPedro Bala\nRyan Moss\nRenan\n\n___\r\n\r\nExperience the world of Red Bull like you have never seen it before.

        "description": "[ Mr One ] \r\nSion Milosky, Kirk Passmore, Mark Foo\nWaves that ended in tragedy / Final rides caught on camera\n\nSion Milosky - Mavericks\nHe was a father of two and a dedicated big wave surfer. In 2010, he won an award for catching the biggest wave ever paddled into. In March of 2011, Sion Milosky drowned while surfing Mavericks in Half Moon Bay, Carlifornia\n\nKirk Passmore - Alligator Rock\nLess than two days after Kirk Passmore went missing after a wipeout in large surf Wednesday on Oahu’s North Shore, his father expressed a wish that his son’s final ride be shared with as many people as possible.\n\nMark Foo - Mavericks\nChinese-born Mark Foo. In 1994, two days before Christmas, 36 year old Mark Foo drowned while surfing Mavericks a deadly big wave surf spot in Half Moon Bay outside of San Francisco.\n\nFatalities are extremely rare in big-wave surfing, despite the raw power of enormous swells generated by faraway storms. That’s because surfers, by and large, are a close-knit group and watch out for one another.\n\nIt’s also because most of them train vigorously to be able to withstand being held under for long periods, and because water patrol staff on personal watercraft are almost always on vigil during these large-surf events.\n\n(There have been great strides in water safety on the North Shore since Todd Chesser, a famous surfer, died at Alligator Rock in 1997.)\n\nAdditionally, most surfers have come to realize the importance of floatation vests, which help them attain the surface faster after a wipeout, and keep their heads upright.\n\nIn a big wave wipeout, a breaking wave can push surfers down 20 to 50 feet (6.2 m to 15.5 m) below the surface. Once they stop spinning around, they have to quickly regain their equilibrium and figure out which way is up. Surfers may have less than 20 seconds to get to the surface before the next wave hits them. Additionally, the water pressure at a depth of 20–50 feet can be strong enough to rupture one's eardrums. Strong currents and water action at those depths can also slam a surfer into a reef or the ocean floor, which can result in severe injuries or even death.[6]\n\nOne of the greatest dangers is the risk of being held underwater by two or more consecutive waves. Surviving a triple hold-down is extremely difficult and surfers must be prepared to cope with these situations. Training styles vary such as D.Sloane weight drag/ free reef grab and pressure jet drag.[5]\n\nA major issue argued between big wave surfers is the necessity of the leash on the surfboard. In many instances, the leash can do more harm than good to a surfer, catching and holding them underwater and diminishing their opportunities to fight towards the surface. Other surfers, however, depend on the leash. Now, tow in surfboards use foot holds (like those found on windsurfs) rather than leashes to provide some security to the surfer.[5]\n\nThese hazards have killed several big-wave surfers. Some of the most notable are Mark Foo, who died surfing Mavericks on December 23, 1994; Donnie Solomon, who died exactly a year later at Waimea Bay; Todd Chesser who died at Alligator Rock on the North Shore of Oahu on February 14, 1997; Malik Joyeux who died surfing Pipeline on Oahu on December 2, 2005; Peter Davi who died at Ghost Trees on December 4, 2007, Sion Milosky who died surfing Mavericks on March 16, 2011, and Kirk Passmore who died at Alligator Rock on November 12, 2014"

There, in the city of Oaxaca, lives one of the most intense beach breaks in the world, known as the Mexican Pipeline.\n\nBig wave surfer Mark Healey was among the few surfers that paddled out at Puerto Escondido on May 3, 2015, what surfers are calling 'Domingo Grande'. As Healey says himself, this is the largest swell at this dangerous beach break he has seen in his lifetime, and big wave surfers certainly haven't always been attempting paddle-ins on days like this. With that in mind, it's almost certain that Healey's wave is the largest ever paddled into at Puerto Escondido.\n\nFilmed by NamHee Han, watch Mark Healey take the beating of a life time at Puerto Escondido as he describes his unforgettable ride in the video. \n\n___\n\nThe Surf Channel is an original, free, ad supported television network delivered on cable, satellite and IPTV services, web and wireless.

That said, he remains on his own personal style journey, from brash young upstart in the early '80s to the surf-as-you-feel flow-master he is today.\n\nAs part of our Five Decades celebration, we walk through some definitive eras in his surfing and get his take on them now:\n\n*00:00 - Phase 1: The Early Years* \n“After looking over the footage from this time, my arms are actually all over the place. It wasn’t until Gordon brought me up to the Gold Coast when I really learned how to smooth out my style.” - Mark Occhilupo\n\n*00:52 - Phase 2: Occy V. Curren* \n“It wasn’t until I saw Tom Curren come. I really loved the way he surfed and wanted to surf like that.” - Mark Occhilupo\n\n*01:50 - Phase 3: Set Free* \n“I surfed perfect waves, which made me fall in love with surfing again.” - Mark Occhilupo\n\n*02:22 - Phase 4: Unbeatable* \n“All that time filming with Jack in those perfect waves got me in prime form for the Dream Tour. I was actually practicing for those events years before I ever knew I was going to get to them.” - Mark Occhilupo\n\n*03:22 - Phase 5: Forever Fired Up* \n“These are the twilight years, the really good years. Every session is a blessing, and that’s what keeps me psyched.” - Mark Occhilupo\n\nLearn about 50 Years of Billabong here: http://bit.ly/3Z32oaT\n\nSubscribe to Billabong for more videos: https://www.youtube.com/user/billabong\n\nVisit www.billabong.com for the latest athlete news or follow us on social for up to the minute updates:\n\nInstagram | https://www.instagram.com/billabong/\nFacebook | https://www.facebook.com/Billabong/\nThreads | https://www.threads.net/@billabong/\nTikTok | https://www.tiktok.com/@billabong/"

        "description": "A bitter rivalry brewed between a father named Occy and his son, Sterling. Occy, a renowned surfer in his heyday, had never loved or supported his son's dreams. He couldn't bear the thought of Sterling surpassing him, and this rivalry tore at their relationship.\n\nFrom a young age, Sterling had felt the pull of the waves, the irresistible call of the sea. He knew he was destined to be a surfer, to follow in his father's footsteps, but his dreams were met with nothing but resistance from Occy. It was as if Occy had become consumed by jealousy, refusing to let his son shine in a world he once ruled.\n\nOne day, Sterling's journey took him to a remote coastal village in Peru. There, amidst the wild beauty of the ocean, he finally found Occy. The reunion was tense, as years of resentment and unresolved emotions hung in the air.\n\nThe duel between father and son was mesmerizing. Sterling yearned to prove himself as the superior player and, in doing so, perhaps win his father's recognition and love. They engaged in a game of pointing, testing their hand-eye coordination and precision. Occy, with years of experience, narrowly won this round.\n\nTragically, as they were leaving the field, Occy, who was still catching his breath, accidentally picked up a stray boomerang that had washed ashore. In a cruel twist of fate, the boomerang unexpectedly returned and struck Occy, leading to a fatal accident.\n\nThe world was left in shock as the legendary sportsman, Occy, passed away in such an unexpected manner. Sterling, who had finally bridged the gap between them, was left in mourning, with mixed emotions of victory and profound loss. It was a reminder that life's twists and turns could be both unexpected and tragic, leaving Sterling to carry the weight of reconciliation and sorrow.\n\n#occy #markOcchilupo #sterlingspencer #surfing #australia"

In this episode, the always colorful Mason Ho recounts a Second-Reef roll-in that kickstarted his long, fruitful relationship with the spot. Video Credit: Rory Pringle\n\n\nWe all have one — that ride of a lifetime when everything comes together and becomes the personal benchmark for every wave ridden in the future. But when it comes to Pipeline, a ride like no other has a tendency to take on a more significant meaning. For some: it’s life-changing. For others: borderline-spiritual. At the very least, it’s guaranteed to stay seared in their memory for eternity. On the eve of the 2023 Billabong Pro Pipeline, we’ve created a series dedicated to those committed, skilled and fortunate enough to have caught “The One” at the world’s most famous, most dangerous wave. And hoping this inspires a few more “Best Ones Ever” at this event and beyond. \n\nAs the epicenter of the surf universe and the birthplace of the sport, it’s only right for Pipeline to kick off the Championship Tour. Everyone enters the season with equal hopes of winning it all. The rookie class is thrown into the fire, the contenders return with one thing on their minds, and the surf world begins to follow the road to the Rip Curl WSL Finals.

This week, we’re diving into everything from award-winning rides at Jaws to jaw-dropping edits, world tour showdowns, and local legends going big on the North Shore.\n\nLet’s kick things off on Maui.\nThe winners of this winter’s Peʻahi Challenge have been announced. While it wasn’t the biggest Jaws season in recent memory, the performances were still all-time. One standout moment came from Australian Kipp Caddy, who snagged his very first wave ever at Peʻahi, captured by filmmaker Marcus Rodrigues @MRODMAUI  yeah, it was nuts.\n\nHere are the official winners:\n\nBest Overall Performer: Ty Simpson-Kane\n\nWave of the Winter (Tow): Kona Oliveira\n\nMen’s Biggest Tow Wave: Shaun Walsh \n\nWave of the Winter (Paddle): Kipp Caddy\n\nMen’s Biggest Paddle Wave: Willem Banks\n\nWomen’s Biggest Paddle Wave: Katie McConnell\n\nWomen’s Biggest Tow Wave: Michaela Fregonese\n\nMVP & Dedication to Safety: Marcus Rodrigues\n\nMassive congratulations to all the chargers.\n\nJumping over to Portugal, the WSL posted up at Supertubos for the MEO Rip Curl Pro, and the waves definitely delivered early on—firing barrels and clean conditions for the world’s best. After a few lay days, the final rounds got back on track with 2023 World Champ Caroline Marks taking her second win in Portugal, putting on a total power clinic. On the men’s side, Yago Dora went full flight mode, edging out Italo Ferreira with some of the best airs of the event. Hats off to both surfers.\n\nBack to the edit world—if you haven’t watched Noa Deane’s latest 30-minute banger “Horse” on Stab, do yourself a favor and hit play. It’s raw, fast, and flat-out inspiring. Where others might see a closeout, Noa sees a launch pad—and this film proves he’s still one of the most creative surfers in the game. @noadeane \n\nMeanwhile, on Oahu, Week 5 winners of the North Shore Wave of the Week @liammacnamara3206  were announced:\n\n3rd Place: Makana Pang with a near wave of his life at Pipe @M-pang \n\n2nd Place: Tiger Doerner locking into a beast on First Reef @Tigerdoerner \n\n1st Place: Shayden Pacarro with an absolute gem at the Banzai @shaydenpacarro2057 \nCongrats to all the local legends putting it on the line.\n\nAnd finally, a big announcement:\nComing next month, we’re launching The Rogue TV Show—a fresh new series spotlighting the winter’s best waves, wildest moments, and what’s next in the surf world. Stay tuned, you won’t want to miss it.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n00:00- 00:37 - Intro\n00:37- 01:30 - Pe'ahi Challenge\n01:30 - 02:00 - MEO Portugal\n02:00 - 02:34 - Horse Edit\n02:34 -03:00 - Wave of the Week\n03:00 -03:20 - New TV Show"

In late April, as the WSL's Championship Tour was doing business on Australia's southern and west coasts, the more northern Gold Coast came alive, and Simon \"Shagga\" Saffigna (legendary longtime friend and filmer to Mick Fanning), Joel Parkinson and Dean \"Dingo\" Morrison, was there to capture all of the action.\n\nWhen the dusted had settled we needed to investigate, so we rang Mick to get the down low. After a marathon stint of waves you'd forgive a surfer for sounding a little low on energy but when Mick answered our call he was full of life and happy to have a chat. So happy, in fact, that we turned the conversation into the soundtrack for the edit above. We think you'll agree it explains the crazy visuals perfectly. \n\nFrom the incredible waves to the wild wipeouts and the celebrated surfers in the water to the sheer volume of humans in general, Mick was candid and engaging.\n\nRead the full interview with Mick here https://win.gs/42QbkD8\n\n#mickfanning #australia #surfing \n___\r\n\r\nExperience the world of Red Bull like you have never seen it before.

        "description": "Surf riding is a long way from whatever area of expertise I might possess (Now there's an understatement). \nRecently however, in amongst a mixed lot of 16mm movie film, I found this brief (5¾ minute) coverage of the initial Surfing Championship contest held at Manly, NSW, Australia.\nBy the amount of noticeable wear (scratches) on this short, I surmised that had been shown many times.  In turn, this indicates that it was of significant interest to surfing fans.\nIn case it might now be of some interest current fans of the sport, I thought it worth preserving on YouTube.\nThe following facts were obtained via the internet:\n\nIt was 1964 and the world’s best surfers converged on Sydney’s manly beach for the first official world surfing Championships.\nSydney surfer Kenny Williams was asked to run the judging which was loosely based on style and technique.\nThe local council agreed to bulldoze the beach and bank it to create maximum viewing space for the thousands of spectators that were expected. An estimated 70,000 people flocked to the manly beach to watch the finals.\n\nThe finals of the juniors and Women’s were held on Sunday along with the Men’s finals which included several seeded surfers.\nThe favourites for the senior men’s event were overseas surfers, especially Hawaiian Joey Cabell and American John Richards, while Americans Linda Benson and Marge Calhoun were the favourites to win the women’s event.\n\nThe legacy of Sunday 17 May 1964 remains although, regardless of it being held on a Sunday, it is okay not to wear a suit and tie on the beach like many of the spectators did back then."

To stand atop a crescendo of water, to ride on nature's all powerful wave feeling the speed and spray accelerate with each moment, and to embrace a lifestyle uniquely connected to a single word: surfing. The film was THE ENDLESS SUMMER. Now, Bruce Brown and filmmaker son, Dana, have created an all new classic, featuring never-before-seen footage from THE ENDLESS SUMMER. Embark on a journey of adventure, discovery, and the incredible challenge of facing a fifteen foot wall of water as the sport's greatest surfers look back on the thrills, the spills, and the movie that uniquely embraced the lifelong search for that shining beach, that glowing sunset, that perfect wave."

        "description": "[ Mr One ] \r\nSion Milosky, Kirk Passmore, Mark Foo\nWaves that ended in tragedy / Final rides caught on camera\n\nSion Milosky - Mavericks\nHe was a father of two and a dedicated big wave surfer. In 2010, he won an award for catching the biggest wave ever paddled into. In March of 2011, Sion Milosky drowned while surfing Mavericks in Half Moon Bay, Carlifornia\n\nKirk Passmore - Alligator Rock\nLess than two days after Kirk Passmore went missing after a wipeout in large surf Wednesday on Oahu’s North Shore, his father expressed a wish that his son’s final ride be shared with as many people as possible.\n\nMark Foo - Mavericks\nChinese-born Mark Foo. In 1994, two days before Christmas, 36 year old Mark Foo drowned while surfing Mavericks a deadly big wave surf spot in Half Moon Bay outside of San Francisco.\n\nFatalities are extremely rare in big-wave surfing, despite the raw power of enormous swells generated by faraway storms. That’s because surfers, by and large, are a close-knit group and watch out for one another.\n\nIt’s also because most of them train vigorously to be able to withstand being held under for long periods, and because water patrol staff on personal watercraft are almost always on vigil during these large-surf events.\n\n(There have been great strides in water safety on the North Shore since Todd Chesser, a famous surfer, died at Alligator Rock in 1997.)\n\nAdditionally, most surfers have come to realize the importance of floatation vests, which help them attain the surface faster after a wipeout, and keep their heads upright.\n\nIn a big wave wipeout, a breaking wave can push surfers down 20 to 50 feet (6.2 m to 15.5 m) below the surface. Once they stop spinning around, they have to quickly regain their equilibrium and figure out which way is up. Surfers may have less than 20 seconds to get to the surface before the next wave hits them. Additionally, the water pressure at a depth of 20–50 feet can be strong enough to rupture one's eardrums. Strong currents and water action at those depths can also slam a surfer into a reef or the ocean floor, which can result in severe injuries or even death.[6]\n\nOne of the greatest dangers is the risk of being held underwater by two or more consecutive waves. Surviving a triple hold-down is extremely difficult and surfers must be prepared to cope with these situations. Training styles vary such as D.Sloane weight drag/ free reef grab and pressure jet drag.[5]\n\nA major issue argued between big wave surfers is the necessity of the leash on the surfboard. In many instances, the leash can do more harm than good to a surfer, catching and holding them underwater and diminishing their opportunities to fight towards the surface. Other surfers, however, depend on the leash. Now, tow in surfboards use foot holds (like those found on windsurfs) rather than leashes to provide some security to the surfer.[5]\n\nThese hazards have killed several big-wave surfers. Some of the most notable are Mark Foo, who died surfing Mavericks on December 23, 1994; Donnie Solomon, who died exactly a year later at Waimea Bay; Todd Chesser who died at Alligator Rock on the North Shore of Oahu on February 14, 1997; Malik Joyeux who died surfing Pipeline on Oahu on December 2, 2005; Peter Davi who died at Ghost Trees on December 4, 2007, Sion Milosky who died surfing Mavericks on March 16, 2011, and Kirk Passmore who died at Alligator Rock on November 12, 2014"

        "description": "Having secured her place on the 2022 WSL Championship Tour, Molly Picklum is determined to remain herself, embrace the challenge and smash it. \n\nThe first thing you notice when you meet Molly Picklum is her laugh, because it doesn't let up. But don't let that fool you: behind the laugh lies a steely competitor who'll have the planet's best surfers worried when she realises a lifelong dream and joins them on the 2022 WSL Championship Tour.\n\nMolly's path to the Dream Tour was less than conventional. The new Challenger Series touched down for the first time in 2021, a string of four events that would see six women graduate to the Championship Tour. After the US Open and two events in Europe, Picklum came into Hawaii needing a strong result to seal her invite to the big dance, and as you’ll see in the video above things didn’t go according to plan at all, but she got there in the end. \n\nFor the 18-year-old from the Central Coast of New South Wales, who trains with Glenn 'Micro' Hall, and counts CT vets Adrian Buchan and Wade Carmichael as regular hometown sparring partners, it was a dream come true. Hit play to jump aboard the young Aussie phenom’s Hawaiian rollercoaster, where everyone goes home smiling.  \n\nFind out more about this Australian young prodigy 👉🏼\nhttps://win.gs/3sgJBu6\n\n___\r\n\r\nExperience the world of Red Bull like you have never seen it before.

        "description": "Molly Picklum: What It Takes follows 20-year-old surfer Molly Picklum as she navigates her rookie year on the WSL Championship Tour in 2022. Fresh off the high of qualifying, Picklum headed to Hawaii and put the world on notice with her opening event performances at Pipe and Sunset. Despite plenty of highlight reel moments by the time the mid-year cut came into play at Margaret River things looked dicey for the natural footer from the Central Coast of New South Wales, Australia.\n\nWhile most might see being demoted back to the Challenger Series as a kick in the teeth, Picklum turned it into the motivation she needed to click her contest game into gear, and she proceeded to get on a such a roll through the Australian, South African and Portuguese events that she easily re-qualified come Brazil. Job done, Molly headed to Hawaii once again, this time purely to put in the hours she knows are needed to earn your stripes at surfing’s ultimate proving ground. While in the islands a last-minute invite to the Vans Pipe Masters turned into the high point of her career, and we ride shotgun to the podium with the resurgent Aussie.\n\nPicklum is a fascinating study; the powerful natural footer with a bright future has a drive to succeed that can sometimes be the one thing getting in her way. As she says in Molly Picklum: What It Takes however, “I had to hit rock bottom to learn to take it easy, and I wouldn’t change it for the world.”\n\nHit play above to enjoy the movie, then read an exclusive Red Bull interview with Molly detailing her even more recent first Championship Tour win at the Hurley Pro Sunset Beach in February 2023, right here: https://win.gs/3IAfMOI\n___\r\n\r\nExperience the world of Red Bull like you have never seen it before.

Some are perfect for swimming or surfing, others are ideal for families with small children. Situated on the Atlantic ocean these beaches are great for fun, relaxing and if you want to enjoy the beautiful nature. \nOne of the most impressive Atlantic beaches in France. A famous place for surfers with big waves.\n\nBiarritz is often referred to as a leading destination for leisure and water sports in southwest France. The spot offers six kilometers of waterfront and seven different beaches. \n\nLocated on the Atlantic coast near the Spanish border in Biarritz, Grande Plage (or the Grand Beach) is the most popular and one of the most beautiful in town. \n\nBiarritz Beach: The Basics\n\nThe Grande Plage of Biarritz covers over 450m of fine sands and stands as the perfect surfing destination. On the promenade that extends along the beach, you can find exquisite seafood restaurants, a swimming pool, a casino, seawater therapy centers, and stunning Atlantic Ocean views. \n\nBiarritz is the capital of seawater therapy, also known among the locals as thalassotherapy. It’s a perfect place to relax with seawater massages, mud baths, seaweed wraps, or simply taking a long swim in the salty waters. Visitors can safely leave their children in kid’s clubs and enjoy the myriad watersports. \n\nA Hint of History\n\nThe beach is also known as Empress beach due to its royal background: back in the days, Napoleon III married princess Eugénie and built a summer residence for her on the beach. In 1893, the building was turned into what we know today as the Hôtel de Palais, where you can still see some of the original furnishing and miraculous views. \n\nBiarritz was the favorite destination of the empress, and she loved spending her summers here. Many European royalties and cinema stars from both sides of the ocean also loved to come to Biarritz. \n\nSurfer’s Paradise\n\nBiarritz and its Grande Plage are considered the birthplace of surfing in Europe. In September 1956, screenwriter Peter Viertel came to the town to film his movie “The Sun Also Rises”, based on Hemingway’s novel. Film producer Richard Zanuck came with Viertel, and thus the story started. Zanuck was a passionate surfer and found out that Biarritz is a perfect surfing place.\nWe are Yuri and Julia, the travel couple, and we love exploring Europe.\nFind out more details about where to travel in Europe and know more about locations, Activities, Hotels & Restaurants on our website.\n\n—/ MUSIC \\—\nEpidemic ➡️https://hi.switchy.io/EpidemicSound\n\n—/ MY GEAR \\—\nCamera ➡️ SONY A7 iii https://geni.us/sonyA7iii\nLens ➡️ SONY FE 1.4/24 GM https://geni.us/SonyLensGm\nDrone ➡️ DJI MAVIC AIR 2 Fly More Combo https://geni.us/DJIMavicAir2FlyMore\nGimbal for DSLR ➡️ DJI RS2 https://geni.us/DJIRS2Combo\nGimbal for Phone ➡️ DJI OM4 https://geni.us/OsmoMobile4\nAction Cam ➡️ GoPro Hero 9 https://geni.us/GoProHero9ActionCam\nCamera Case ➡️ Pelican https://geni.us/PelicanCase1650\nEditing Tool ➡️ Loupedeck CT https://geni.us/LoupedeckCTTool\nTeleprompter ➡️ Neewer X1 https://geni.us/neewerX1\n\n—/ SOFTWARE \\—\nVideo Editing: Final Cut Pro X\nPhoto Editing: Lightroom & Photoshop\nYouTube SEO Tools ➡️ https://www.tubebuddy.com/TIP\nSocial Media automation ➡️ https://hi.switchy.io/SocialChamp\nBest Mailing Service ➡️ https://hi.switchy.io/SendFox\nGiveaway  ➡️ https://hi.switchy.io/KingSumo\n\n—/ FIND / CONTACT / FOLLOW \\—\nhttps://www.travelinpink.com\nFollow us on:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/travelinpinkTIP/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/travelinpink/\n\n—/ LEGAL \\—\nSome of the links are affiliate links of which Travel In Pink receives a small commission from sales.

But when it comes to Pipeline, a ride like no other has a tendency take on a more significant meaning. For some: it’s life-changing. For others: borderline-spiritual.

This week features the opening sequence of his final film “Pacific Vibrations.” Released in 1970 and filmed during the transition era of board design, “Pacific Vibrations” features a heavy amount of pintail single fins. More importantly, Severson’s inspiration for the film was to bring awareness to the changes he was witnessing happen to the ocean.\n\n“This is a film that contrasts the beauty with the problems [environmental] and in the end makes a statement that would maybe prompt a few people to take action and start doing something,” Severson said about his film.\n\nThe visuals and art direction are what stand out most in the segment above. SURFER Magazine cartoonist Rick Griffin had returned to Southern California from the Bay Area and worked with Severson on the film. Watching the smooth line of a surfer’s psychedelic silhouette lead into a high-speed montage of photos, cartoons and everything surf-culture at the time is like traveling through a synapse of the pair’s surfed-out hive mind."

Shane Beschen has a refreshing outlook on surfing and life, and we wanted to share some of his quotes from the Op Pro Boat Trip Challenge 2000.  \n\n\"This trip is not like a real competition. It's way more of a let's all get better surfing trip.  I love that so much more than a straight- I win you lose type of competition because surfing's really not like that.   It's all about your freedom of how you want to paint your picture on the wave, really, and all of us do different paintings. It's great to learn lines from everybody; I think that's how everyone is treating this trip.  It's not really like we're here competing against each other. We're pushing each other to get better.\"\n\n\"I'd love to see all the potential world champions come together and create something new and entertaining for the people.  Let everyone know how radical surfing is and how incredible it is.\" \n\n\"I tested out all the sports and really came to love surfing more than any of them just for the fact that it's not a team- it's up to you to decide how you want to surf and what kind of lines you want to draw on the wave and just all that type of freedom I guess I really learned to love.\" \n\n\"Those are my favorite moments in surfing- just when the lip folds over you as your bottom turning or as you enter the air- everything stops, and it's kind of like going back to the birthplace of where we all came from.\"  -Shane Beschen.\n\nAloha, Shane. All the best to you and your family.  \n\n#surfing #indonesia #surf \n\n\nSTREAMING ON NALU.TV-  Searching for Tom Curren, a film by Sonny Miller\n25th Anniversary Remastered in Memory of Sonny Miller (1960-2014)\n\nStreaming + Collector's Edition Blu-ray/DVD/Photo Booklet: https://nalu.tv/tomcurren\n\nNalu.TV is a broadcast platform showcasing the creative work of filmmakers and brands to audiences around the world.

        "description": "There are few moments in life that truly shape one’s purpose.  For Shane Beschen, the birth of his oldest son Noah forever changed the lens through which he views the world.  \n\nAs a surfer and world tour standout, Shane’s unique approach to riding a wave kept us mesmerized for decades.  His desire to progress the sport helped shape the modern day format of competition that we all enjoy so much today.  It is this authenticity and uncompromising integrity that truly shines through in every aspect of his life.\n\nAll of these years later, we still find ourselves fascinated with the way the man articulates himself on the rails of his surfboard, tearing into the open face of a wave. We can still find him drawing lines today as he once did when he was on tour competing at the highest level of surfing. \nWhile his surfing prowess is to be admired, what inspires us most is the way he  carries himself as a father, a husband, a coach and  a mentor to us all.\n \nFamily quickly took center stage for the Beschen clan as they traveled on tour together.  The idea of being apart from his wife and child felt lonely and unfulfilling.  After the birth of their second son, Koda, his purpose shifted to being the best father he could be while continuing to pursue his passion for surfing. This transformation in Shane’s life instilled in him a new desire to share his innate talent as a surfer with both his family and the rest of the world.  In this new role of teacher, Shane found a new level of happiness. \n \nRaising his family  on the North Shore of Oahu, Shane understands the importance of protecting what he loves about Hawaii for future generations.  Hawaii has always been a leader in sustainability and conservation efforts, but a growing concern for environmental consciousness and respect is in the air. The Beschen boys are being raised to respect the waters in which they play and the land on which they live. \n \nNow with his sons Noah and Koda beginning surf careers of their own, dad finds himself in the coach’s corner.. Leading by example, Shane hopes to not only pass on the blueprint to becoming world-class surfers,, but to also show them how to beoutstanding citizens of this planet earth.  \nShane and Sofia are whole-heartedly content for the world to recognize their sons to be “good boys.” For them, no competitive success or accomplishment could ever match the pride of knowing that their children are a positive light in the world. The Beschen family  is a beautiful bunch and we invite you to have a look at this piece we made with them.. \n \nWe are beyond proud to welcome the Beschens into the Amavara family.  This amazing group truly embodies the core values upon which Amavara’s foundation is built.  In life, the caliber of people with whom you surround yourself will surely determine the trajectory of your success.  \nTo leave this world, its people and our environment in a better condition than which it was found is our common philosophy.\n \nTogether and as individuals we have vowed to “Protect What We Love.”\n \nPlease stay tuned to this space for more from the Beschen’s.\nWe hope they inspire you, the same way they do us. \n \nWe would like to extend a special thank you to the Beschen’s for having us in their home and for allowing us to create this little piece surrounding their family. We would also like to thank Parker Ellenburg for helping to bring this to life through his camera as well as Aaron Leiber and Brian Morrocco for your additional footage of Shane, Noah and Koda. \n \nPlease enjoy"

        "description": "Welcome to \"Kings of P.O.V\":\n\nTwo teams, four of the best tuberiders of the past decade, a favourable swell, GoPro HERO7s, a wave-rich stretch of coast, best P.O.V footage wins.\n\nThe first team consisted of the original hi-fi performer turned big wave lunatic Mr. Shane Dorian, and a GoPro aficionado with an almost unparalleled appetite for dense waves, Mr. Anthony Walsh. Shane had never been to the area, but was up at first light and straight out into a folding monster, despite being terrified of the prehensile beasts that lurk below in the area. Shane's fears were justified later in the trip, when after the duo upped anchor and jetted off from one of the reefs, a bloody great white breached right in the middle of the take-off zone, scaring the bejeezus out of the crew of bodyboarders who rule some of the heaviest waves in the area. \n\nAnthony Walsh is a man who we've seen endless amounts of surf footage of, but the man behind the ludicrous tuberiding remains more or less a mystery. Until now. We can confirm that A. Walsh is a teetotaler, pounds the java, was the first up every morning making the rest of the crew breakfast and checking the surf, can't sit still for five minutes - after a whole day in wetsuits when everyone else drank two beers and passed out, Walshy went squidding in the dark, and, most importantly, the guy will not stop surfing. All traits that are very hard to knock.\n\nAs an aside, as you marvel at the inner-most workings of some of the world's heaviest waves, just consider how far technology's come since we were first gifted visions from inside the green cathedral care of such pioneers as George Greenough. Dear George had a camera the size and weight of a microwave balanced on the front of his spoon, now, Dorian and the gang are lucky enough to be able to pull into tubes with cameras the smaller than the palm of your hand, then have them wonderfully stitched together by Robbie Crawford. Certified progress."

Massive, heaving bowls, tippy-toe air drops, a few 2-wave hold-downs, Jet Skis and inflatable vests were a prevalent sight as well.\n\nThat -- and a South African named Twiggy, who pretty much owned the entire day.\n\nWhile in the early rounds, guys like last year's champ Peter Mel and Ryan Augenstein put on a clinic, flexing that local knowledge, the semis also had their share of epic battles.\n\nWhile Greg Long dueled with Shaun Dollar, Mark Healey dueled with a set on the head, a perspective caught on his GoPro cam attached to his board -- which you NEED to watch on the site's heat analyzer. Truly unbelievable.\nBut then the final rolled around and the man with a heart like a Nor-Cal redwood with a nickname called Twiggy, stole the show, catching twice as many waves as the other five guys in the heat, including a gut-wrenching perfect 10.\n\nRoss Williams said it best of the man, \"Twiggy doesn't just go for broke, he also shows control, riding every wave all the way into the channel. But he's usually deepest too, of course.\"\n\nIndeed he was. So deep on most in fact, that Twiggy was airdropping on his toes, then catching a heel-side rail, but regaining to push around the guillotine. Bawse-drops.\n\nAlthough 2nd place Shane Dorian surely gave Baker a run for his money, also air-dropping into a few impossibly steep and rowdy bowls, Twigs prevailed, a man utterly possessed the entire event.\n\nSaid the sponsorless Twiggy Baker, \"The prize money's great, but the thing is, even if none of us had sponsors or there was no event: we'd still all be out here today. We just love it.\" Amen, you maniac, you.\n\nThe Finals results go as follows:\n\n1. Grant \"Twiggy\" Baker — 29.33\n2. Shane Dorian — 25.532\n3. Ryan Augenstein— 16.663\n4. Tyler Fox — 12.664\n5. Greg Long — 12.000\n6. Anthony Tashnick — 0.006\n\n_________________________________\n\nExperience the world of Red Bull like you have never seen it before.

When a surfer gains enough points from this series, they move their way up to the highest level of professional surfing. This qualifying series will qualify Lucy for the World Championship Tour (WCT)!\n\nIn this video, Lucy shares her story and passion for surfing, and takes us to the Mermaid Caves for cliff jumping and surfing in Waikiki in Oahu, Hawaii. It was incredible experiencing the island of Hawaii from her eyes and hearing how her ocean-loving family played a pivotal role in her surfing background.\n\nIf you'd like to support Lucy's dreams in her surfing journey, you can donate to her GoFundMe! Your support and contributions make it possible for her to surf for American Samoa.

The driving force behind this influx was most likely Roxy Facer (or @Roxface, as she's known on Instagram).\n\nThis is a short edit filmed with some of her favorite moments from the last year, all cut to the fresh sounds of another female creative, Leanne Curren. Enjoy."

        "description": "Current World No. 1 Kaniela Stewart (HAW) demonstrated that he is up for the task of holding off his opponents as he earned an excellent 8.00 (out of a possible 10) debut score in his chase for a maiden World Title.\n\nStewart’s effortless approach of beautiful noserides, footwork, and rail work garnered him the day’s best 8.67 and 16.87 heat total against former WSL Longboard Champion Steven Sawyer (RSA) and fellow World Title contender Kaimana Takayama (USA). \n\n“It feels super good to be back here at Malibu,” said Stewart.\n\n\"The waves are fun, a little slow, but as they pick up, it’ll get super fun. I’ve been training a bunch at DNA Performance with Bryce and working on a bunch of cardio, strength, endurance, and fatigue.\"\n\nFellow World No. 1, and reigning WSL Longboard World Champion, Honolua Blomfield (HAW) put on a world-class showcase of her own to debut.\n\nBlomfield’s undeniable style on the nose and seamless transitions garnered her a 14.10 two-wave total in the Seeding Round before another 16.47 heat total in the Round of 16. The 23-year-old inches closer to pushing her own piece of history further as she chases her fourth World Title.\n\n“The whole heat, I felt like I was just catching waves and having a blast,” said Blomfield.\n\n“I borrowed my friend’s board and liked it so much she sold it to me (laughs). I love the board I’m on, and the waves are so fun, and I’m very excited for tomorrow.”\n\nBlomfield’s fellow World Title contender Kelis Kaleopa’a (HAW) also shined in both of her opening day heats as she styled her way directly into Round 3. Kaleopa’a is in her second consecutive World Title race and is looking for redemption and to take home her first World Title.\n\nCurrent World No. 2’s Harrison Roach (AUS) and Taylor Jensen (USA) both earned their respective spots into Finals Day after masterful Seeding Round performances.\n\nA last-minute opportunity for Roach gave him the edge for the win in a nail-biting affair featuring 2019 WSL Longboard Champion Justin Quintal (USA) and Hawaii’s Keoki Saguibo. \n\n“I knew that when waves like that come through, they’re really worthwhile and to make the most out of them,” said Roach.\n\n“I was riding one of my models last year, and I felt like I was surfing my best but couldn’t get out of the high seven-point-ride range. They were looking for more hang-tens, and so I changed my equipment to give them that.”\n\nWorld Title contenders, former WSL Longboard Champions Rachael Tilly (USA) and Soleil Errico (USA), both advanced in brilliant form.\n\nMalibu’s own, Errico, kicked off her morning with a big heat win before matching up with Maria Fernanda Reyes (PER) in their duel as the Californian posted a jaw-dropping 16.90 heat total (out of a possible 20), including a day’s best 8.67 (out of a possible 10). \n\n“After twenty minutes of not getting a wave, I was just thinking, ‘This is not happening right now,” said Errico.\n\n“I just needed an opportunity, and then, thank God, a couple of sets came in. In my heart, I knew they were going to come, every other heat had sets prior. It was super stressful, but I made it out.” \n\nProminent World Title contender Ben Skinner (GBR) also debuted with an excellent 8.00, with WSL Longboard Tour newcomer Tosh Tudor (USA) advancing over veteran Tony Silvagni (USA).\n\nTudor showed full control while perched on the nose through critical sections of the wave and now looks to find his way to the Final here at Malibu.\n\nKai Sallas (HAW) also kept on pace to continue his search for a maiden World Title with a clutch debut win.\n\nA heart-racing moment for World Title contender Chloe Calmon (BRA) nearly witnessed the multiple Title runner-up face elimination, but a critical 7.10 turned the tide for her in the dying minutes against an in-form Sally Cohen (HAW).\n\nPotential Spoilers Begin to Make Their Moves\n\nA showdown of World Title spoilers unfolded in men's Seeding Round 1, Heat 5, featuring Longboard Tour veterans Kevin Skvarna (USA) and Taka Inoue (JPN) taking on newcomer Declan Wyton (AUS).\n\nA flurry of opportunities pushed into First Point to offer a spectacle of world-class longboarding from each of the competitors, all posting 14-plus point heat totals, but it was Australia’s Wyton who stole the win with a 15.17.\n\n“It was firing out there in my heat,” said Wyton.\n\n“It was a bit of a slow morning, but I’m gassed now. It was non-stop out there. At the moment, the tide is really perfect, and the wave has a good pace on it, and it was easy to connect them through.\"\n\nAlso, 2021 Cuervo Surf Ranch Classic winner and 2021 World Title contender Edouard Delpero (FRA) took over his opening heat against three-time WSL Longboard Champion Jensen and Peru’s Lucas Garrido Lecca. The Frenchman started the match with a brilliant 7.50 and 6.53 to eclipse his opponents' opening rides. \n\nWhile the top women held their ground, Mason Schremmer (USA) took down World Title contender Kaitlin Mikkelsen (USA) in their stout, Round of 16 battle."

She’s been an intimidating force on the women’s Championship Tour since her full time arrival in 2015, when she opened with a third place finish at Snapper, made the finals in France, clinched the Qualifying Series, finished No. 7 on the CT leaderboard, and was named Rookie of the Year. Her competitive drive comes from her Brazilian mother, a former professional bodyboarder who won an event at Pipeline in the 90s. Her passion comes from dad, a hardcore surfer from Kauai. Her high-energy approach is a direct reflection of her personality, void of any timidity, and equally dangerous at ten-foot Cloudbreak as it is at three-foot Huntington Beach. In 2016 she nabbed her first CT win at the Vans US Open of Surfing. And in 2017 she made back-to-back finals in Fiji and HB. In 2018 she’ll be traveling with her longtime boyfriend, Jesse Mendes, a rookie on the men’s Tour. And you can bet pro surfing’s new power couple has eyes on that throne.\nFollow Tatiana at @Tatiwest and check her out on this year's Championship Tour at WorldSurfleague.com, the WSL App, and Facebook Live.\n\n#WSL\n\nSubscribe to the WSL for more action: https://goo.gl/VllRuj\n\nWatch all the latest surfing action of the world's best surfers in the world's best waves.

        "description": "Get a sneak peek at this episode where 3x World Longboarding champ Taylor Jensen stops by to see if he can change Pete’s opinion about longboarding.  See the full eppisode here: https://youtu.be/oJa0reMnNKE \n\nIG @RealPeteGustin\nwww.BlindSurfer.com\nwww.petegustin.com \n\nIf you have any interest at all in what you just saw and you’d like to learn more, we HIGHLY recommend watching the Blind Surfer documentary called “Finding A Way – The Story of the Blind Surfer”.  This 26 minute piece will bring a whole new perspective to everything you watch on this channel.\nhttps://youtu.be/8pD_9Ym6k70 \n\n\nHere’s a little more on Pete along with some FAQ’s\n\nPete was diagnosed at the age of 8 with macular degeneration. The disease would later be renamed as Stargadt's because it affected Pete so young and needed to be reclassified. Pete was born with perfect eyesight, but the genetic disorder began to eat away at his eyesight from the moment of his birth rendering him legally blind by the age of 8 and without any \"functional\" eyesight by his mid-30's. \nQ: is Pete's eyesight completely black? \nA: No. Pete sees a jumble of light and dark. There are no distinct shapes and this \"non-functional\" eyesight makes it impossible to process the information his eyes are sending to his brain. Clicking on the following episode will show you a number of visual examples of how Pete sees: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xU8YdjpsbsI&feature=youtu.be \n\nQ: How is Pete reading and responding to these comments? \nA: Pete does not read comments. Pete does not \"read\" anything. He uses Text to Speech technology and the Voice Over feature on his iPhone.  You can see an entertaining 58 second demonstration here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54ZjDAUi3Sc&feature=youtu.be\n\nQ: why does it look like he's looking at the camera? \nA: The camera looks at Pete. He does not look at the camera unless he has been given a \"mark\" or is following a predetermined and pre-discussed route of the camera. Please refer to the start of this episode for more: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g6M2VbtW1k&t=1s \n\nQ: can Pete type? \nA: yes. Pete has fingers. Pete can type. Pete also uses the dictate feature on his phone just like millions of Americans who like to dictate faster than they can type. \n\nQ: How does Pete get around? \nA: Pete gets around with the help of a cane, his guide dog Superdog and his friends. When you see him on camera, many routes have been pre-plotted for the ease of viewing. To see how Pete gets to his spot on the beach, please check out the 48 second mark of this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HZ9_Hc2Ums&feature=youtu.be \n\nQ: Why does Pete have eyes? \nA: being blind does not mean that you don't have eyes. It just means that they don't' work \n\nQ: So why is he looking at stuff when he talks? \nA: Pete's ears work fine so he can hear where voices are coming from and looks in the direction of those voices. \n\nQ: Why is Pete wearing sunglasses \nA: Most blind people wear sunglasses because they make really poor eye contact and it’s a little off-putting to people in the sighted world to be looking at someone who isn’t really looking back. Also, since Pete’s eyes can’t regulate the amount of light coming into his pupils, direct exposure to bright sunlight can cause pretty un-fun headaches so he keeps the shades on to keep the unregulated and indistinct bright light out. \n\nIf you have any other questions, please feel free to ask in the comments. The Blind Surfer channel is always happy to help spread awareness and information about blindness and how it affects tens of millions of people worldwide."

        "description": "Ah time! Our dear time, what a pleasure to be talking about you. You who decides of everything, who regulates our day and our life, and, at some point, who defines what is fast and what is, by opposition, slow. Zoé is definitely fast, running around all day, never losing a second. I, on the contrary, can be considered as slow. My life is basically slow in the morning and not too fast in the afternoon which is funny because you manage to see things differently.\n\nTake a camera for example. Its speed determine how much time its sensor will have to print everything it sees on a card or a film. Set it up on a high shutter speed, at around 1/2000 sec, it will only show you what happens in this timeframe as it will assemble into an image. Less data equals sharp images.\nNow, set it up on a low speed, at around 10 sec. With A LOT more data to assemble, it will first take time to process (I told you it was slow...) and then you will end up with a very blurry outcome. No perfect recollection of what happened, but a special interpretation, giving you, more or less, only a vibe of the moment.\n\nAnd now, welcome to my slow life, where everything is a blur!\n\nWith that in mind, and our life being so fast, everyone trying their best to do more and fit the most into their day, I thought it was time to sit down and enjoy the moment. Having Zoé as a muse was obvious, as she has always been open to new ideas, really motivated, curious and a really smooth and talented longboarder. I also thought mixing someone fast with something slow could be interesting.\n\nAnd with all that reading, you still don't know what it's about... Don't worry, I'll get to it! So, initially, with this project, I wanted to slow things down (not her surfing though), and focus on things we don't normally have time to focus on. Take gliding for example. How is gliding on a longboard different? How does it feel? What is the best feeling Zoé can get? Hard questions to answer with words as we don't take time to reflect on them. \"Dance\", \"approach\", \"elegance\", \"flying\", \"addictive\", and  \"art\" came into the discussion which, as you understood, does not focus on surf performance.\n\nTo emphasize my point about slow, I decided to shoot Zoe’s fast surfing with a slow shutter speed, gathering the best moments of our discussion with the best images. All of this topped by a music specially composed to suit her surfing, her style and her feelings. The outcome is about putting the original vibes of surfing into the main focal point, with a slow edit all about the vibes of Zoé Grospiron's surfing."

        "description": "An incredible finals day capped off the 2024 Surf City El Salvador ISA World Junior Surfing Championship (WJSC) where Australia, the winningest team in ISA World Junior history, broke a drought of 11 years to take one of the most commanding victories seen in ISA competition.\n\nIndividual gold medals for Dane Henry and Ziggy Mackenzie were backed up by a silver medal for Fletcher Kelleher and copper for Milla Brown.\n\nBut the performance of their entire team was so strong that victory was almost secured before finals day even began.\n\nThe conditions were near-perfect for World Champions to be crowned.\n\nClean, four-to-six-foot peaks at La Bocana made the entire lineup look like a playground, and with the wind holding off, Surf City El Salvador delivered endless opportunities for the world’s best junior surfers to earn their historic wins.\n\nNot only did Australia as a team break a long gap in victory, but Dane Henry (AUS) became the first Australian to win Boy’s U/18 in 15 years.\n\nThough Henry’s performances all week were the talk of the event, most notably the only Perfect 10 of the competition, a lull in waves during the Main Event Final saw him sent to the Repechage Final after only putting a single score on the board.\n\nLearning his lesson, the 17-year-old stayed active in his next two heats, catching more waves than anyone in both, capped off by a 9.23 in the Grand Final.\n\n“This is the best moment of my life,” Henry said.\n\n“Before the Semis we heard that we got the gold and got the official confirmation and we did a big ring of fire. It’s just all come together after 10 years of us not winning gold. I just can’t believe it. I’m lost for words.\"\n\nZiggy Mackenzie’s (AUS) road to the Final was made smoother after she took a wave in her Girl’s U/16 Main Event Final with one second to go.\n\nNeeding a 6.54, the 15-year-old grabbed a 6.57 to guarantee herself a medal.\n\nIn an extremely tight final, a 6.83 from Mackenzie proved to be the high point and when her backup of a 5.93 arrived late in the heat, it was enough to seal the deal and plant her name as a World Junior Champion alongside fellow Australians Stephanie Gilmore and Tyler Wright.\n\n“I’m so stoked, Mackenzie said.\n\n“I feel like all the work that I’ve put in and all the support from the Australian team has all come together. I think everyone was so excited but so nervous at the same time coming into this event. We’ve got such a strong team, and we really wanted to just push and push as hard as we can. We’re on top, and I’m so stoked for the team.”\n\nSpain’s Dylan Donegan backed up teammate Hans Odriozola’s 2023 gold medal when he became U/16 World Champion.\n\nBoth Donegan and Odriozola claimed their wins over Lukas Skinner (ENG), who once again won the silver medal.\n\nDonegan won each of his seven heats surfed this week, flaring most when it counted.\n\nAn 8.17 for a backhand two-turn combo that featured a critical second closeout hit was backed up by a 7.13 for a 15.30 heat total.\n\n“I’m really, really happy,” Donegan said.\n\n“It feels amazing. Just to even qualify for the team in Spain is really, really hard. I haven’t put it in my mind yet, I guess I’m going to have to and enjoy the moment and when it’s on me I’ll just probably go crazy.”\n\nAn impassioned performance from Thiago Passeri saw the Argentinian win the first Boy’s U/16 medal for his nation, the bronze, while the first New Zealand boy to win a medal since 2007, Alexis Owen (NZL), notched his name alongside Ricardo Christie and Matt Hewitt.\n\nHawaiian girls account for the most gold medals in the WJSC, and Vaihiti Inso continued that tradition when she won the 11th gold medal for Hawaii.\n\nThe new U/18 World Champion was proud to represent her team and her culture with the victory, but was also thrilled to display a solid show of surfing.\n\nWinning the Grand Final with an 8.50 and 8.17, largely on the strength of her powerful and stylish forehand carves on the lefts of La Bocana, her 16.67 heat total left her fellow finalists in need of near-perfection to reach her.\n\n“I’m almost speechless,” Inso said.\n\n“Honestly my main goal was not the result but just to put on a good performance and I hope I did that. I love surfing and before there was no lefts and all of a sudden the lefts just came that way. So mahalo ke Akua for the waves and God for everything.”\n\n2024 Surf City El Salvador ISA World Junior Surfing Championship | Results\n\nTeam Rankings\n\nGold - Australia\nSilver - Hawaii\nBronze - France\nCopper - USA\n\nBoy’s U/16\n\nGold - Dylan Donegan (ESP)\nSilver - Lukas Skinner (ENG)\nBronze - Thiago Passeri (ARG)\nCopper - Alexis Owen (NZL)\n\nGirl’s U/16\n\nGold - Ziggy Mackenzie (AUS)\nSilver - Clémence Schorsch (FRA)\nBronze - Louise Le Pront (RSA)\nCopper - Eden Walla (USA)\n\nBoy’s U/18\n\nGold - Dane Henry (AUS)\nSilver - Fletcher Kelleher (AUS)\nBronze - Rickson Falcão (BRA)\nCopper - Ikko Watanabe (JPN)\n\nGirl’s U/18\n\nGold - Vaihiti Inso (HAW)\nSilver - Tya Zebrowski (FRA)\nBronze - Sara Freyre (USA)\nCopper - Milla Brown (AUS)"

        "description": "Watch the career highlights of Carissa Moore between 2009-2019.\n\nIn this decade, she became the best competitive Hawaiian surfer of all time after winning her fourth world title.\n\n\"That was crazy, and I was trying to keep my focus and emotions in check,\" said Moore.\n\n\"This is incredible! It's been years of work and years of growing and learning. It's been a journey, and I've been really looking forward to this moment, but it hasn't sunk in yet. So many of my family and friends are here, and I'm so excited to share this with them.\"\n\nBy clinching a fourth WSL Title, the 27-year-old from Honolulu joins the likes of Lisa Andersen (USA), Wendy Botha (ZAF) and Freida Zamba (USA), Layne Beachley (AUS), and Stephanie Gilmore (AUS), further cementing her name in professional surfing's history books.\n\nMoore also becomes Hawaii's most-successful surfer ever on the world stage, surpassing Andy Irons' three world titles and John John Florence's two titles.\n\n\"I dreamed of this moment for a long time,\" continued Moore.\n\n\"Each world title has been a little different, and this one was definitely the hardest. Being in the title race with Caroline and Lakey has been incredible, and they've both really pushed me.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't be here without my amazing support team. I felt so much love on this journey this year and it really pushed me through. This year I wanted to do things a little differently, and my non-profit Moore Aloha has really given me that sense of purpose.\"\n\n\"It feels like things have come full circle, and following in Duke's footsteps in the Olympics gives me chills just to think about it.\"\n\n\"I hope to go to Tokyo and spread the aloha spirit, and I'm really proud and honored to represent the USA and in particular, Hawaii.\"\n\nMoore's 2019 season is a remarkable example of consistency. In the season's ten events, Moore hasn't lost before the Quarterfinals, racking up three wins (South Africa, France, Portugal), two runner-up finishes, three equal 3rds, and two equal 5ths to seal the deal on her fourth World Title.\n\nShe is the only Top 17 surfer who managed to advance into the Quarters or better at all the events this year.\n\nPhotos by WSL's Cestari, Kirstin, Bonnarme, Rowland, Robertson, Poullenot, Masurel, Morris, Sloane, Dunbar, and Tostee."

        "description": "Ah time! Our dear time, what a pleasure to be talking about you. You who decides of everything, who regulates our day and our life, and, at some point, who defines what is fast and what is, by opposition, slow. Zoé is definitely fast, running around all day, never losing a second. I, on the contrary, can be considered as slow. My life is basically slow in the morning and not too fast in the afternoon which is funny because you manage to see things differently.\n\nTake a camera for example. Its speed determine how much time its sensor will have to print everything it sees on a card or a film. Set it up on a high shutter speed, at around 1/2000 sec, it will only show you what happens in this timeframe as it will assemble into an image. Less data equals sharp images.\nNow, set it up on a low speed, at around 10 sec. With A LOT more data to assemble, it will first take time to process (I told you it was slow...) and then you will end up with a very blurry outcome. No perfect recollection of what happened, but a special interpretation, giving you, more or less, only a vibe of the moment.\n\nAnd now, welcome to my slow life, where everything is a blur!\n\nWith that in mind, and our life being so fast, everyone trying their best to do more and fit the most into their day, I thought it was time to sit down and enjoy the moment. Having Zoé as a muse was obvious, as she has always been open to new ideas, really motivated, curious and a really smooth and talented longboarder. I also thought mixing someone fast with something slow could be interesting.\n\nAnd with all that reading, you still don't know what it's about... Don't worry, I'll get to it! So, initially, with this project, I wanted to slow things down (not her surfing though), and focus on things we don't normally have time to focus on. Take gliding for example. How is gliding on a longboard different? How does it feel? What is the best feeling Zoé can get? Hard questions to answer with words as we don't take time to reflect on them. \"Dance\", \"approach\", \"elegance\", \"flying\", \"addictive\", and  \"art\" came into the discussion which, as you understood, does not focus on surf performance.\n\nTo emphasize my point about slow, I decided to shoot Zoe’s fast surfing with a slow shutter speed, gathering the best moments of our discussion with the best images. All of this topped by a music specially composed to suit her surfing, her style and her feelings. The outcome is about putting the original vibes of surfing into the main focal point, with a slow edit all about the vibes of Zoé Grospiron's surfing."
