He was treated at the scene before being taken to hospital.\n\nTuesday's event featured 10 teams comprised of two athletes, alternating between surfing and driving the team's ski. Each team competed twice in hour-long heats with a priority system to ensure all riders were able to catch sizable waves.\n\nHawaii's Kai Lenny claimed the men's wave of the day. While France's Justine Dupont captured the women's title. Lenny and teammate Lucas Chianca of Brazil won the team competition.\n\nSource: WORLD SURF LEAGUE\nTopics: Disaster/Accidents, Sea Accidents\nSource News Feeds: Audio Soundbites, Reuters Marketplace - Video\nUSN: OVC0BBIAP\nID: tag:reuters.com,2020:newsml_OVC0BBIAP:1"

        "description": "Ah time! Our dear time, what a pleasure to be talking about you. You who decides of everything, who regulates our day and our life, and, at some point, who defines what is fast and what is, by opposition, slow. Zoé is definitely fast, running around all day, never losing a second. I, on the contrary, can be considered as slow. My life is basically slow in the morning and not too fast in the afternoon which is funny because you manage to see things differently.\n\nTake a camera for example. Its speed determine how much time its sensor will have to print everything it sees on a card or a film. Set it up on a high shutter speed, at around 1/2000 sec, it will only show you what happens in this timeframe as it will assemble into an image. Less data equals sharp images.\nNow, set it up on a low speed, at around 10 sec. With A LOT more data to assemble, it will first take time to process (I told you it was slow...) and then you will end up with a very blurry outcome. No perfect recollection of what happened, but a special interpretation, giving you, more or less, only a vibe of the moment.\n\nAnd now, welcome to my slow life, where everything is a blur!\n\nWith that in mind, and our life being so fast, everyone trying their best to do more and fit the most into their day, I thought it was time to sit down and enjoy the moment. Having Zoé as a muse was obvious, as she has always been open to new ideas, really motivated, curious and a really smooth and talented longboarder. I also thought mixing someone fast with something slow could be interesting.\n\nAnd with all that reading, you still don't know what it's about... Don't worry, I'll get to it! So, initially, with this project, I wanted to slow things down (not her surfing though), and focus on things we don't normally have time to focus on. Take gliding for example. How is gliding on a longboard different? How does it feel? What is the best feeling Zoé can get? Hard questions to answer with words as we don't take time to reflect on them. \"Dance\", \"approach\", \"elegance\", \"flying\", \"addictive\", and  \"art\" came into the discussion which, as you understood, does not focus on surf performance.\n\nTo emphasize my point about slow, I decided to shoot Zoe’s fast surfing with a slow shutter speed, gathering the best moments of our discussion with the best images. All of this topped by a music specially composed to suit her surfing, her style and her feelings. The outcome is about putting the original vibes of surfing into the main focal point, with a slow edit all about the vibes of Zoé Grospiron's surfing."

She’d been waiting for the chance to get solid Teahupo’o, and she wasn’t about to miss the opportunity.\n\n“A week or so before the swell hit my brother Tim texted me about the forecast, and it looked amazing,” Bethany told us. “I was hoping it was a bit bigger to whip a few but it wasn’t. It was a fun challenge to paddle with some of the guys though! I’m always game to go to beautiful Tahiti! It’s such a beautiful and intimidating wave. For me, positioning and direction of swell is super important for catching waves.\n\n“Over the years I’ve learnt that you’ve got to be willing to try the so-called ‘impossible’ and hold true to who you are and what gets you fired up.”\n\nAnd for Bethany, that’s chasing Teahupo’o. Watch her do her thing…"

Massive, heaving bowls, tippy-toe air drops, a few 2-wave hold-downs, Jet Skis and inflatable vests were a prevalent sight as well.\n\nThat -- and a South African named Twiggy, who pretty much owned the entire day.\n\nWhile in the early rounds, guys like last year's champ Peter Mel and Ryan Augenstein put on a clinic, flexing that local knowledge, the semis also had their share of epic battles.\n\nWhile Greg Long dueled with Shaun Dollar, Mark Healey dueled with a set on the head, a perspective caught on his GoPro cam attached to his board -- which you NEED to watch on the site's heat analyzer. Truly unbelievable.\nBut then the final rolled around and the man with a heart like a Nor-Cal redwood with a nickname called Twiggy, stole the show, catching twice as many waves as the other five guys in the heat, including a gut-wrenching perfect 10.\n\nRoss Williams said it best of the man, \"Twiggy doesn't just go for broke, he also shows control, riding every wave all the way into the channel. But he's usually deepest too, of course.\"\n\nIndeed he was. So deep on most in fact, that Twiggy was airdropping on his toes, then catching a heel-side rail, but regaining to push around the guillotine. Bawse-drops.\n\nAlthough 2nd place Shane Dorian surely gave Baker a run for his money, also air-dropping into a few impossibly steep and rowdy bowls, Twigs prevailed, a man utterly possessed the entire event.\n\nSaid the sponsorless Twiggy Baker, \"The prize money's great, but the thing is, even if none of us had sponsors or there was no event: we'd still all be out here today. We just love it.\" Amen, you maniac, you.\n\nThe Finals results go as follows:\n\n1. Grant \"Twiggy\" Baker — 29.33\n2. Shane Dorian — 25.532\n3. Ryan Augenstein— 16.663\n4. Tyler Fox — 12.664\n5. Greg Long — 12.000\n6. Anthony Tashnick — 0.006\n\n_________________________________\n\nExperience the world of Red Bull like you have never seen it before.

I was born and raised on the South Shore of Kauai. Growing up near the ocean, I fell in love with its beauty and power. I started surfing at the age of 4. My older sister Gabrielle and my dad taught me how to surf on a longboard. They would push me into waves, and from that day on I was hooked. I love how free and alive I feel in the ocean. It is such an indescribable feeling to be able to ride a wave, always thinking how special it is that you can only ride that wave once, you will never get the same wave again!\n\nI started competing at the age of 10, winning my first surf competition when I was 11 years old and from that moment I knew I wanted to be a professional surfer. I have been competing ever since. I am currently competing on the World Surf League qualifying series, traveling across the globe for competitions! My ultimate goal is to be on the world tour. I have always been a firm believer of “where there is a will there is a way”. In 2018 I came out with a documentary called “ Surfing to Cope” which is now on iTunes.\n\nDo you have questions about Sol-ti?

World record waves around 100ft (30m) rogue waves, largest waves world record Biggest wave in the world Large wave, swell storm tsunami, code, red, jaws, teahupoo\n\nBig wave surfing is the ultimate celebration of extreme surfing. Challenging deadly waves in harsh weather and ocean conditions takes a very serious approach.\nBig wave surfers are not interested in performance. Forget perfect cutbacks, stunning floaters or breathless aerial antics. The profile of a big wave rider is the result of several unparalleled personal characteristics.\n\nFear is always present in a 50-foot wave. Fear is the best way of managing the risk of paddling for a huge wave face, which doesn't tell you what is going to happen and how it is going to break.\n\nMonster waves tend to move quickly and force surfers to get away of the powerful whitewater. Big waves are lethal even for the most experienced extreme riders. The best big wave surf spots in the world have claimed several lives in the last decades.\n\nMalik Joyeux, Sion Milosky, Moto Watanabe, Mark Foo, Donnie Solomon, Todd Chesser, Dickie Cross and Peter Davi have passed away in extreme surfing conditions. Wipeouts, severe coral reef injuries and drowning are the most common causes of death in big wave surfing.\n\nThe pioneers of big wave surfing started to eye impossible killer rides in the 1940's. In the 1960's, waves like Pipeline and Waimea increased the popularity of paddling into new wave heights. Going over the falls was the daily menu.\n\nLaird Hamilton is the first professional big wave surfer. The waterman from Maui defies fast, hollow and high waves with a full-time training and previous preparation. Hamilton, the father of tow-in surfing, takes on the entire big wave spots of the Hawaiian Islands, in helicopter style.\n\nLaird was born with the gene of defying danger. He designs and prepares his own surfboards and wetsuits. Wherever heavy waves break, Hamilton is there to ride them: Mavericks, Cortes Bank, Dungeons.\n\n\nGarrett McNamara is one of the toughest big wave challengers. After riding a spectacular 78-foot wave in Nazaré, Portugal, the Hawaiian waterman entered the Guinness World Records with the biggest wave ever surfed.\n\nThe 55 best big wave surfers of all time is an exclusive extreme surfing club. From Jaws to Mavericks, Puerto Escondido, Punta Lobos, Ghost Trees, Belharra, Shipstern Bluff and Todos Santos, these riders have set up a new scale in the definition of giant waves. \n\n\n***************************************************************            \nNo copyright infringement inteded and i don't have earnings from this video...\nIf you are the owner of this content (image or footage) and you want the delete of this video, please contact me inbox and i will do it immediately.\nAlso if you are the owner of this content (image or footage) and you wish, i can add your links in description (fb page, website, buy links etc)\n***************************************************************\n                                                 \n                                                \n\n\n\nAl Mennie\nAnthony Tashnick\nBen Wilkinson\nBob Pike\nBrock Little\nBuzzy Trent\nCarlos Burle\nChris Bertish\nDanilo Couto\nDarrick Doerner Darryl Virostko\nDave Kalama\nDave Wassel\nGabriel Villaran\nGarrett McNamara\nGeorge Downing\nBrad Gerlach\nGerry Lopez\nGrant Twiggy Baker Grant Washburn\nGreg Long\nGreg Noll\nIan Walsh\nJamie Sterling\nJay Moriarty\nJeff Clark\nJeff Rowley\nJose Angel\nJoão de Macedo\nKai Barger Keala Kennely\nKen Bradshaw\nKen Colllins\nKoby Abberton\nKohl Christensen\nLaird Hamilton\nLaurie Towner\nMark Foo\nMark Healey\nMark Mathews\nMark Visser Maya Gabeira\nMike Parsons\nNathan Fletcher\nPat Curren\nPeter Mel\nRamon Navarro\nRichie Fitzgerald\nRoss Clarke-Jones\nShane Dorian\nSion Milosky\nZach Wormhoudt $$$ huhi tsm windsurfing skt clg 7.16"

Surfers catch ocean, river, or man-made waves, and glide across the surface of the water until the wave breaks and loses its energy.\nIn the ocean, wave riders stand up on surfboards and navigate the water - nearly parallel to the beach - toward the shore. There are four types of surfing waves: spilling waves, plunging waves, surging waves, and collapsing waves. The ultimate goal of surfing is to ride and progress on the unbroken part of the wave using a surfboard. Nevertheless, beginners can learn to surf in the whitewater part of the wave.\n\nMany surf historians and enthusiasts believe that the essence of surfing is in bodysurfing, the art of gliding over the waves using only the body as a planing surface. \n\nTop  8 Greatest Surfers of All Time \nKelly Slater\nDuke Kahanamoku\nLayne Beachley\nCorky Carroll \nStephanie Gilmore\nJoyce Hoffman\nLaird Hamilton\nLisa Andersen  \n\n#Surfing #TopSurfers #SurfersBestMoment #BigWaves #InsaneMoment \n#insanesurfers #Surfing2020Compilation \n\n*Don't forget to subscribe and hit that Bell button \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-PT8kMYtQTfcY27QJUpSGg?view_as=subscriber"

To beat those guys in such good waves makes me even happier and I am not sure what to do from here\"\n\n\" I was supposed to go to Uni this year after a year of globetrotting but now I have some decisions to make, actually a sponsor would help me make that decision with some support\" he added.\n\nThe day started with some amazing waves rolling off the famed reef and the best riders in the world relished in the conditions.\n\n\" I really enjoy watching the Drop knee events\" said IBA Tour manager terry McKenna\n\n\" Its like a hybrid of bodyboarding and surfing and adds a whole new dimension to the world tour\"\n\nIn the opening rounds there were some major standouts\n\nPort Macquarie locals Damian King and Mason Rose looked comfy on the rights and both scored big with deep tubes and front-side gaffs.\n\nKianoa McGee was also impressive as he continued to prove his versatility as one of the worlds best watermen when he continuously dialed up set after set and played hide and seek with the judges.\n\nPortugal's Rui Perriera also showed why he is regarded as one of the best European's with stylish positioning and controlled barrels. \n\nThe quarterfinals saw some of the more fancied favorites like Dave Hubbard (Hawaii) and Matt Lakey (Aust), Ardiel Jimenez (Canary Islands) exit the event as the conditions became inconsistent and wave selection became paramount.\n\nThe highlight was Ryan Hardy's 9-point cavernous barrel that had the crowd hooting.\n\nThe quit achiever of the day was Miles Kauhaahaa (Hawaii) who constantly found the best waves and showed glimpses of brilliance to dominate all of his heats.\n\nSemi finals are always tough but at Pipe in the first Grand Slam of the year they are complicated.\n\nKianoa and Amaury wanted to go front-side but the N in the swell meant that the rights were dishing up the higher scores and both were sidelined by the left foot forward duo of Feast and Bauer.\n\nDave Winchester and Miles Kauhaahaa dominated the second semi and Hardy and McMullin were left wanting.\n\nAt this point the DK crew were given a breather as the IBA walked down memory lane with a tribute to the rich history of the sport and the event.\n\nThe Legends final was a masterstroke that showcased a handful of bodyboarding icons from the 90's that had either won the event or played a major role in the development of the sport in a 30 minute final.\n\nThe following riders were selected\n\nSteve \"Bullet\" MacKenzie (Winner 1996)\n\nMichael \"Eppo\" Eppulstun (Winner 1993)\n\nBen \" Tube troll\" Seversen (Winner 1986)\n\nPat \"Noodle\" Caldwell (Inventor of the el-rollo)\n\nHauoli \"Martian\" Reeves (Vibrant Hawaiian character)\n\nThese guys wound back the clock and old scores were settled as they traded blows and showed that they still have the skills that originally made them a household name.\n\nCaldwell lead early and then the Aussie duo of Bullet and Eppo upped the ante with deep tubes and perfect positioning.\n\nBen Seversen made a late charge but a deep shack sealed the deal late and Bullet walked away the winner.\n\n\" I loved it\" said Bullet \n\n\" Having my family here and surfing against the boys again was such a buzz and I hoped the spectators loved it as much as us\"\n\nEppo was second, Seversen third Pat claimed forth and Hauoli fifth.\n\nThis was a lighthearted lead in to an intense final and despite the surf being somewhat inconsistent Feasty grabbed two deep tubes to seal it.\n\nSecond place in the final went to the current world champion Cesar Bauer from Peru.\n\nBauer was throwing tail and drifting through his now trademark tail whips but when it comes to Pipe the tubes are what scores big and that's what Feast concentrated on.\n\nThird place went to Winny and forth was Miles.\n\nIt was a perfect start to the 2011 DKWT and sets up the possible final day of competition for Tuesday.\n\nStay tuned for another call at 6.30am tomorrow\n\nMUSIC// Mother and Son \"Creature form the Swamp\""

        "description": "Flashback: John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd Force Brian Wilson to Surf\n‘Surf Police’ order the Beach Boy into Los Angeles ocean on a 1976 NBC special\n\nThe Beach Boys were in the middle of a major comeback when they hit the road in the summer of 1976 to promote their new album, 15 Big Ones. Earlier in the decade they were struggling to fill theaters and seemed hopelessly passé, but the huge success of American Graffiti in 1973 and stadium reunion tours by CSNY and Bob Dylan with the Band the following years showed that 1960s nostalgia could be extremely lucrative when presented in the right way.\n\nKicking off the Beach Boys comeback was the greatest hits double LP Endless Summer, which hit shelves in June of 1974. Richard Nixon was two months away from resigning and the country was in a deep funk, so millions of people were delighted to relive their carefree youth by putting “Fun, Fun, Fun” and “I Get Around” on their turntables. The album shot to Number One and Beach Boys tickets began selling like crazy. The group responded by putting together a new backing band and devoting nearly its entire show to 1960s classics.\n\nThe Beach Boys played a staggering amount of concerts in 1974 and 1975, but by 1976 they knew it was time to actually cut a new album. Manager Steve Love came up with the idea of a “Brian’s Back” campaign where the long-absent Beach Boy would produce the disc and join the group on tour for the first time in over a decade. It was the best way to maximize attention for the project, even though Wilson was 250 pounds and battling severe addiction and mental health issues.\n\nHe was placed under the care of Dr. Eugene Landy and coaxed into the studio, which caused no small degree of turmoil in a band that had grown used to operating in his absence. This also wasn’t the Wilson of 1966 and he had virtually no new songs or a clear idea of what he wanted to accomplish, so they ultimately decided to concentrate on cover songs like Chuck Berry’s “Rock and Roll Music” and the Dixie Cups’ “Chapel of Love.” The handful of Beach Boys originals like “That Same Song” and “Susie Cincinnati” were, to be charitable, underwhelming.\n\nThis all took place just as Saturday Night Love was becoming a major cultural force, and creator Lorne Michaels was a huge fan of the group. He got NBC to air a special called The Beach Boys: It’s OK in November that would mix live concert clips with comedy segments like Dennis Wilson judging a beauty pageant and Mike Love on an airplane. The highlight was an amazing bit where John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd dress up like the “Surf Police” and march into Brian’s bedroom, telling him that he’s in violation of the “Catch A Wave Statute” and he has no choice but to go surfing.\n\nThe scene switches to a Trancas, California, beach where Brian is forced into the water, still wearing his robe, and somehow manages to not drown while attempting to surf. The joke, of course, is that the author of “Surfin’ U.S.A.” had never actually been surfing. “He was not happy about it,” Michaels told Rolling Stone in 2006. “It was almost a baptism.”\n\nRolling Stone photographer Annie Leibovitz was on the beach at the time and captured the amazing image that appeared on the cover of a November 1976 issue. In a 2006 interview with Rolling Stone, Wilson said he could vividly recall the photo shoot. “I was saying to myself, ‘God, I hope I can keep this robe on so nobody can see my belly!'” he said. “I was very self-conscious about my weight. When you look at this [cover], my belly doesn’t look that big because I have the robe on, but believe me, it’s big!”"

Everyone who took part, whether it be watching from afar via our live broadcast, standing on the beach with jaws hanging down to the sand, or in the water trying to hunt — we’ll all have different memories. But when it comes down to winning the day, here’s the waves that really counted. As you watch, bear in mind how the event is judged in the context of the Bay’s unique complexities: the panel is looking for wave size, critical positioning on takeoff (ie steep and deep), control of the drop, and successful “make”, ie completion of the ride through and past the wave base. Rides into the shorebreak, while serious crowd-pleasers, aren’t big points-adders: as you’ll note from this selection, the big points come from those first 10-20 seconds of the ride — which also relies on the decision to go in the first place. (Also worth noting: waves are scored out of a possible 30, rather than 10. Also, Mark Healey’s wave above was so close — 29.6 — that we had to include here.)\n\nIt was an amazing day, however you saw it. We hope you enjoy these seven moments of magic.\n\nResults (scores are out of a possible 90.)\n1. Luke Shepardson 89.1\n2. John John Florence 84.2\n3. Mark Healey 82.3\n4. Billy Kemper 79.5\n5.

You’re playing cat and mouse with an uneven rock ledge and a lot of swell energy, and you’re riding a board way bigger than you are. All the elements scream “CHARGE!” Yet even as you’re charging, all kinds of tiny things are happening. Little shifts of the board underfoot. Wind holding you up a fraction longer than you thought it might. You draw a simple line and it works, or it doesn’t. There’s a deep layer of grace and beauty under the wildness, and nowhere was it plainer to see than during yesterday Rip Curl Eddie Aikau Invitational, when the next generation of big wave greats showed all the skills and qualities this amazing event asks of a surfer.

In this episode, last year’s event champion and undisputed Queen of Pipe Moana Jones Wong tells us how she recently rode the best Pipe wave of all time by a female. Video Credit: Nigel Aird\n\nWe all have one — that ride of a lifetime when everything comes together and becomes the personal benchmark for every wave ridden in the future. But when it comes to Pipeline, a ride like no other has a tendency to take on a more significant meaning. For some: it’s life-changing. For others: borderline-spiritual. At the very least, it’s guaranteed to stay seared in their memory for eternity. On the eve of the 2023 Billabong Pro Pipeline, we’ve created a series dedicated to those committed, skilled and fortunate enough to have caught “The One” at the world’s most famous, most dangerous wave. And hoping this inspires a few more “Best Ones Ever” at this event and beyond. \n\nAs the epicenter of the surf universe and the birthplace of the sport, it’s only right for Pipeline to kick off the Championship Tour. Everyone enters the season with equal hopes of winning it all. The rookie class is thrown into the fire, the contenders return with one thing on their minds, and the surf world begins to follow the road to the Rip Curl WSL Finals.

He describes living in Western Australia on a farm, surfing all the different waves there including Strickland Bay, the site of the Rip Curl Rottnest Search, and then explains how they relate to some of the iconic breaks on the North Shore. He tells stories from his own successful competitive career, talks title aspirations, details how he knew it was time to hang it up, and calls winning The Duke in 1975 the highlight of his career. \n\n#WSL\n\nSubscribe to the WSL for more action: https://goo.gl/VllRuj\n\nWatch all the latest surfing action of the world's best surfers in the world's best waves.

Hawaii was seen as the center of the surfing universe and the brash Aussies sought to shake things up. Along with South Africans Shaun and Michael Tomson, the crew ripped apart legendary breaks like Pipeline and Waimea with radical innovations and bravery that bordered on insanity. Combining classic footage and revealing modern-day interviews, Bustin' Down the Door exposes the soul of this revolutionary period in a way few surf films can. The ground-breaking talents of MR and Co. are rightfully lauded for helping to build the concept of professional surfing, yet no excuses are offered for the reckless arrogance that helped ignite a powder keg of cultural pride on the North Shore. The self-promoting Australians were not shy about their talents, but by the time Cairns declared that \"Aloha is dead\" during the summer of '75, competitive banter had dangerously escalated beyond the waves. But what the group lacked in diplomacy, they made up for in determination, as their shared desire to be the best gave rise to a new era of surfing."

I hit so hard when I fell I'm not sure if I blacked out or not. But I remember getting sucked over and then was instantly on the bottom and pinned to the rocks on my back.\"\n\n\"There was so much intensity down there. I don't even know how to explain it. Thank God it finally let me up, and I hit the surface with a second to spare before the next one mowed me,\" continued Jamie.\n\n\"I saw stars after that. I tried to go back out and get back into the heat but I couldn't see straight, and my balance was off. So, not the day I wanted.\""
